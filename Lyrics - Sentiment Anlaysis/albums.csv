915,01/06/72,Eagles,The Eagles,Train Leaves Here This Morning,"Don't look back, I'm just on my way back home"
916,01/06/72,Eagles,The Eagles,Train Leaves Here This Morning,"There's a train leaves here this morning,"
917,01/06/72,Eagles,The Eagles,Train Leaves Here This Morning,I don't know what I might be on
918,01/06/72,Eagles,The Eagles,Train Leaves Here This Morning,"She signed me to a contract,"
919,01/06/72,Eagles,The Eagles,Train Leaves Here This Morning,Baby said it would all be so life-long
920,01/06/72,Eagles,The Eagles,Train Leaves Here This Morning,I looked around then for a reason
921,01/06/72,Eagles,The Eagles,Train Leaves Here This Morning,When there wasn't something more to blame it on
