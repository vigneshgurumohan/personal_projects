6527,2003,Palestine,PREAMBLE
6528,2003,Palestine,"In the Name of God, the Merciful and the Compassionate."
6529,2003,Palestine,"The continuous attachment of the Arab Palestinian people to the land of their fathers and forefathers, on which this people has historically lived, is a fact that has been expressed in the Declaration of Independence, issued by the Palestine National Council. The strength of this attachment is confirmed by its consistency over time and place, by keeping faith with and holding onto national identity, and in the realization of wondrous accomplishments of struggle. The organic relationship between the Palestinian people, their history and their land has confirmed itself in their unceasing effort to prompt the world to recognize the rights of the Arab Palestinian people and their national entity, on equal footing with other nations."
6530,2003,Palestine,"The birth of the Palestinian National Authority in the national homeland of Palestine, the land of their forefathers, comes within the context of continuous and vigorous struggle, during which the Palestinian people witnessed thousands of their precious children sacrificed as martyrs, injured persons and prisoners of war, all in order to achieve their people’s clear national rights, the foremost of which are the right of return, the right to self-determination and the right to establish an independent Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as a capital, under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole, legitimate representative of the Arab Palestinian people wherever they exist."
6531,2003,Palestine,"Within the framework of the interim period, resulting in the Declaration of Principles Agreement, the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority with its three pillars - the legislative, executive and judicial branches - became among the most urgent of national missions. The establishment of the Palestinian Legislative Council, through free and direct general elections, made the adoption of a Basic Law suitable for the interim period a necessary foundation upon which to organize the mutual relationship between the government and the people. It is a first step on the way to determining the distinguishing characteristics of a civil society capable of achieving its independence. At the same time, it is a basic foundation upon which to enact unifying legislation and law for the Palestinian national homeland."
6532,2003,Palestine,"This Basic Law has established a firm foundation, representing the collective conscience of our people, including its spiritual components, its national faith and its nationalist loyalty. The titles of the Basic Law include a group of modern constitutional rules and principles that address public and personal rights and liberties in a manner that achieves justice and equality for all, without discrimination. Further, they ensure the rule of law, strike a balance between the executive, legislative and judicial branches, and draw lines between their respective jurisdictions in a manner that ensures independence to each of them while coordinating their roles to achieve a high national interest that will serve as a guide to all."
6533,2003,Palestine,"The enactment of this temporary Basic Law for a transitional and interim period constitutes a fundamental step towards the realization of the firm national and historical rights of the Arab Palestinian people. It shall not in any way whatsoever abrogate or cancel their right to continue to strive to achieve their rights of return and self-determination, including the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem (al-Quds al-Sharif) as its capital, which is the first shrine and the third mosque, to which the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, traveled by night, in the land of the nativity of Jesus, may peace be upon him."
6534,2003,Palestine,"The provisional character of the Basic Law shall not abrogate the right of any Palestinian, wherever residing, to exercise equal rights with his/her fellow citizens on the soil of the homeland."
6535,2003,Palestine,"This temporary Basic Law draws its strength from the will of the Palestinian people, their firm rights, their continuous struggle and the exercise of their democratic right - as represented in the election of the President of the Palestinian National Authority and the members of the Palestinian Legislative Council - to commence the organization and establishment of a sound, democratic and legislative life in Palestine. At the same time, the enactment and ratification of this law by the Legislative Council does spring from the fact that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole and legitimate representative of the Arab Palestinian people."

8331,1975,Papua New Guinea,1. No Constitutional Law takes effect so as to affect the operation of any provision of such a law in force immediately before the commencement of the first-mentioned law unless it was made in the manner and form required for the alteration of that provision.
8332,1975,Papua New Guinea,"2. For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that Subsection (1) extends to Schedule 1 (Rules for Shortening and Interpretation of the Constitutional Laws) in its application to any provision of this Constitution."
8333,1975,Papua New Guinea,"17. PRESCRIBED MAJORITY OF VOTES"""
8334,1975,Papua New Guinea,"1. Subject to this section, in relation to a proposed law to alter any provision of this Constitution the prescribed majority of votes for the purposes of Section 14 (making of alterations to the Constitution and Organic Laws) is the majority of votes prescribed by this Constitution in relation to that provision, or if no majority is prescribed a two-thirds absolute majority vote."
8335,1975,Papua New Guinea,"2. For the purposes of Subsection (1) the prescribed majority of votes for this subsection, Sections 3, 6, 8, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26 to 31 (inclusive), 63, 68, 69, 73, 77 to 98 (inclusive), 101, 103, 104, 110, 117, 138, 139, 150, 156, 165, 167, 171, 184 to 187 (inclusive), 206, 248 to 252 (inclusive), 264 to 268 (inclusive), Sch. 1.21, Sch. 2.1 to Sch. 2.14 (inclusive), Schedules 3, 4 and 5 is an absolute majority."
8336,1975,Papua New Guinea,"3. For the purposes of Subsection (1) the prescribed majority of votes for this subsection, Sections 35, 36, 50, 57, 105, 106, 109, 113, 125, 126, 155, 157, 160, 163, 217, 235, 239, 243, 244, 245 and 269 is a three-quarters absolute majority."
8337,1975,Papua New Guinea,"4. Subject to this section, for the purpose of a proposed law to add a new provision to this Constitution the prescribed majority of votes is the same as the prescribed majority of votes that would be required to alter that provision if it was already enacted."
8338,1975,Papua New Guinea,"5. Subject to Section 12(3) (Organic Laws), in relation to a proposed Organic Law the prescribed majority of votes is-"
8339,1975,Papua New Guinea,a.in the case of a proposed Organic Law to alter a provision of an Organic Law - the same as the majority that would be required for the making of the provision proposed to be altered; and
8340,1975,Papua New Guinea,b.in any other case-
8341,1975,Papua New Guinea,i.the majority of votes (not being less than an absolute majority) prescribed by this Constitution for the making of the Organic Law; and
8342,1975,Papua New Guinea,"ii.if no majority is prescribed, a two-thirds absolute majority."
8343,1975,Papua New Guinea,"6. Where, by virtue of the operation of the preceding provisions of this section, there are different prescribed majorities in relation to different provisions of a proposed law, the prescribed majority of votes in relation to the law as a whole is the greatest of those majorities."
8344,1975,Papua New Guinea,7. Nothing in this section prevents different majorities being prescribed in respect of different aspects or subject-matters of a provision.
8345,1975,Papua New Guinea,8. No Organic Law may require a majority of votes for the alteration of a provision of an Organic Law greater than that by which the first-mentioned law was made.
8346,1975,Papua New Guinea,"9. Notwithstanding anything in this section, until 16 September 1980-"
8347,1975,Papua New Guinea,"a.for the purpose of a proposed law to add a new provision to this Constitution, the prescribed majority of votes is an absolute majority; and"
8348,1975,Papua New Guinea,b.for the purpose of making an Organic Law for which there was provision in this Constitution when adopted the prescribed majority of votes is an absolute majority.

8491,1975,Papua New Guinea,DIVISION 3. BASIC RIGHTS
8492,1975,Papua New Guinea,SUBDIVISION A. INTRODUCTORY
8493,1975,Papua New Guinea,32. RIGHT TO FREEDOM
8494,1975,Papua New Guinea,"1. Freedom based on law consists in the least amount of restriction on the activities of individuals that is consistent with the maintenance and development of Papua New Guinea and of society in accordance with this Constitution and, in particular, with the National Goals and Directive Principles and the Basic Social Obligations."
8495,1975,Papua New Guinea,"2. Every person has the right to freedom based on law, and accordingly has a legal right to do any thing that-"
8496,1975,Papua New Guinea,a.does not injure or interfere with the rights and freedoms of others; and
8497,1975,Papua New Guinea,"b.is not prohibited by law,"
8498,1975,Papua New Guinea,and no person-
8499,1975,Papua New Guinea,c.is obliged to do anything that is not required by law; and
8500,1975,Papua New Guinea,d.may be prevented from doing anything that complies with the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b).
8501,1975,Papua New Guinea,"3. This section is not intended to reflect on the extra-legal existence, nature or effect of social, civic, family or religious obligations, or other obligations of an extra-legal nature, or to prevent such obligations being given effect to by law."
8502,1975,Papua New Guinea,"33. OTHER RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, ETC"
8503,1975,Papua New Guinea,"Nothing in this Division derogates the rights and freedoms of the individual under any other law and, in particular, an Organic Law or an Act of the Parliament may provide further guarantees of rights and freedoms and may further restrict the limitations that may be placed on, or on the exercise of, any right or freedom (including the limitations that may be imposed under Section 38 (general qualifications on qualified rights))."
8504,1975,Papua New Guinea,34. APPLICATION OF DIVISION 3
8505,1975,Papua New Guinea,"Subject to this Constitution, each provision of this Division applies, as far as may be-"
8506,1975,Papua New Guinea,a.as between individuals as well as between governmental bodies and individuals; and
8507,1975,Papua New Guinea,"b.to and in relation to corporations and associations (other than governmental bodies) in the same way as it applies to and in relation to individuals,"
8508,1975,Papua New Guinea,"except where, or to the extent that, the contrary intention appears in this Constitution."
8509,1975,Papua New Guinea,SUBDIVISION B. FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
8510,1975,Papua New Guinea,35. RIGHT TO LIFE
8511,1975,Papua New Guinea,1. No person shall be deprived of his life intentionally except-
8512,1975,Papua New Guinea,a.in execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of an offence for which the penalty of death is prescribed by law; or
8513,1975,Papua New Guinea,b.as the result of the use of force to such an extent as is reasonable in the circumstances of the case and is permitted by any other law-
8514,1975,Papua New Guinea,i.for the defence of any person from violence; or
8515,1975,Papua New Guinea,ii.in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained; or
8516,1975,Papua New Guinea,"iii.for the purpose of suppressing a riot, an insurrection or a mutiny; or"
8517,1975,Papua New Guinea,iv.in order to prevent him from committing an offence; or
8518,1975,Papua New Guinea,v.for the purpose of suppressing piracy or terrorism or similar acts; or
8519,1975,Papua New Guinea,c.as the result of a lawful act of war.
8520,1975,Papua New Guinea,2. Nothing in Subsection (1)(b) relieves any person from any liability at law in respect of the killing of another.
8521,1975,Papua New Guinea,36. FREEDOM FROM INHUMAN TREATMENT
8522,1975,Papua New Guinea,"1. No person shall be submitted to torture (whether physical or mental), or to treatment or punishment that is cruel or otherwise inhuman, or is inconsistent with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person."
8523,1975,Papua New Guinea,"2. The killing of a person in circumstances in which Section 35(1)(a) (right to life) does not, of itself, contravene Subsection (1), although the manner or the circumstances of the killing may contravene it."
8524,1975,Papua New Guinea,37. PROTECTION OF THE LAW
8525,1975,Papua New Guinea,"1. Every person has the right to the full protection of the law, and the succeeding provisions of this section are intended to ensure that that right is fully available, especially to persons in custody or charged with offences."
8526,1975,Papua New Guinea,"2. Except, subject to any Act of the Parliament to the contrary, in the case of the offence commonly known as contempt of court, nobody may be convicted of an offence that is not defined by, and the penalty for which is not prescribed by, a written law."
8527,1975,Papua New Guinea,"3. A person charged with an offence shall, unless the charge is withdrawn, be afforded a fair hearing within a reasonable time, by an independent and impartial court."
8528,1975,Papua New Guinea,4. A person charged with an offence-
8529,1975,Papua New Guinea,"a.shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law, but a law may place upon a person charged with an offence the burden of proving particular facts which are, or would be, peculiarly within his knowledge; and"
8530,1975,Papua New Guinea,"b.shall be informed promptly in a language which he understands, and in detail, of the nature of the offence with which he is charged; and"
8531,1975,Papua New Guinea,c.shall be given adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; and
8532,1975,Papua New Guinea,d.shall be permitted to have without payment the assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used at the trial of the charge; and
8533,1975,Papua New Guinea,"e.shall be permitted to defend himself before the court in person or, at his own expense, by a legal representative of his own choice, or if he is a person entitled to legal aid, by the Public Solicitor or another legal representative assigned to him in accordance with law; and"
8534,1975,Papua New Guinea,"f.shall be afforded facilities to examine in person or by his legal representative the witnesses called before the court by the prosecution, and to obtain the attendance and carry out the examination of witnesses and to testify before the court on his own behalf, on the same conditions as those applying to witnesses called by the prosecution."
8535,1975,Papua New Guinea,"5. Except with his own consent, the trial shall not take place in his absence unless he so conducts himself as to render the continuance of the proceedings in his presence impracticable and the court orders him to be removed and the trial to proceed in his absence, but provision may be made by law for a charge that a person has committed an offence the maximum penalty for which does not include imprisonment, (except in default of payment of a fine), to be heard summarily in his absence if it is established that he has been duly served with a summons in respect of the alleged offence."
8536,1975,Papua New Guinea,6. Nothing in Subsection (4)(f) invalidates a law which imposes reasonable conditions that must be satisfied if witnesses called to testify on behalf of a person charged with an offence are to be paid their expenses out of public funds.
8537,1975,Papua New Guinea,"7. No person shall be convicted of an offence on account of any act that did not, at the time when it took place, constitute an offence, and no penalty shall be imposed for an offence that is more severe in degree or description than the maximum penalty that might have been imposed for the offence at the time when it was committed."
8538,1975,Papua New Guinea,"8. No person who shows that he has been tried by a competent court for an offence and has been convicted or acquitted shall again be tried for that offence or for any other offence of which he could have been convicted at the trial for that offence, except upon the order of a superior court made in the course of appeal or review proceedings relating to the conviction or acquittal."
8539,1975,Papua New Guinea,9. No person shall be tried for an offence for which he has been pardoned.
8540,1975,Papua New Guinea,10. No person shall be compelled in the trial of an offence to be a witness against himself.
8541,1975,Papua New Guinea,"11. A determination of the existence or extent of a civil right or obligation shall not be made except by an independent and impartial court or other authority prescribed by law or agreed upon by the parties, and proceedings for such a determination shall be fairly heard within a reasonable time."
8542,1975,Papua New Guinea,"12. Except with the agreement of the parties, or by order of the court in the interests of national security, proceedings in any jurisdiction of a court and proceedings for the determination of the existence or extent of any civil right or obligation before any other authority, including the announcement of the decision of the court or other authority, shall be held in public."
8543,1975,Papua New Guinea,"13. Nothing in Subsection (12) prevents a court or other authority from excluding from the hearing of the proceedings before it persons, other than the parties and their legal representatives, to such an extent as the court or other authority-"
8544,1975,Papua New Guinea,"a.is by law empowered to do and considers necessary or expedient in the interests of public welfare or in circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice, the welfare of persons under voting age or the protection of the private lives of persons concerned in the proceedings; or"
8545,1975,Papua New Guinea,"b.is by law empowered or required to do in the interests of defence, public safety or public order."
8546,1975,Papua New Guinea,"14. In the event that the trial of a person is not commenced within four months of the date on which he was committed for trial, a detailed report concerning the case shall be made by the Chief Justice to the Minister responsible for the National Legal Administration."
8547,1975,Papua New Guinea,15. Every person convicted of an offence is entitled to have his conviction and sentence reviewed by a higher court or tribunal according to law.
8548,1975,Papua New Guinea,"16. No person shall be deprived by law of a right of appeal against his conviction or sentence by any court that existed at the time of the conviction or sentence, as the case may be."
8549,1975,Papua New Guinea,17. All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.
8550,1975,Papua New Guinea,18. Accused persons shall be segregated from convicted persons and shall be subject to separate treatment appropriate to their status as unconvicted persons.
8551,1975,Papua New Guinea,19. Persons under voting age who are in custody in connection with an offence or alleged offence shall be separated from other persons in custody and be accorded treatment appropriate to their age.
8552,1975,Papua New Guinea,"20. An offender shall not be transferred to an area away from that in which his relatives reside except for reasons of security or other good cause and, if such a transfer is made, the reason for so doing shall be endorsed on the file of the offender."
8553,1975,Papua New Guinea,21. Nothing in this section-
8554,1975,Papua New Guinea,a.derogates Division III.4 (principles of natural justice); or
8555,1975,Papua New Guinea,b.affects the powers and procedures of village courts.
8556,1975,Papua New Guinea,22. Notwithstanding Subsection 21(b) the powers and procedures of village courts shall be exercised in accordance with the principles of natural justice.
8557,1975,Papua New Guinea,SUBDIVISION C. QUALIFIED RIGHTS
8558,1975,Papua New Guinea,GENERAL
8559,1975,Papua New Guinea,38. GENERAL QUALIFICATIONS ON QUALIFIED RIGHTS
8560,1975,Papua New Guinea,"1. For the purposes of this Subdivision, a law that complies with the requirements of this section is a law that is made and certified in accordance with Subsection (2), and that-"
8561,1975,Papua New Guinea,a.regulates or restricts the exercise of a right or freedom referred to in this Subdivision to the extent that the regulation or restriction is necessary-
8562,1975,Papua New Guinea,"i.taking account of the National Goals and Directive Principles and the Basic Social Obligations, for the purpose of giving effect to the public interest in-"
8563,1975,Papua New Guinea,A.defence; or
8564,1975,Papua New Guinea,B.public safety; or
8565,1975,Papua New Guinea,C.public order; or
8566,1975,Papua New Guinea,D.public welfare; or
8567,1975,Papua New Guinea,E.public health (including animal and plant health); or
8568,1975,Papua New Guinea,F.the protection of children and persons under disability (whether legal or practical); or
8569,1975,Papua New Guinea,G.the development of under-privileged or less advanced groups or areas; or
8570,1975,Papua New Guinea,ii.in order to protect the exercise of the rights and freedoms of others; or
8571,1975,Papua New Guinea,"b.makes reasonable provision for cases where the exercise of one such right may conflict with the exercise of another,"
8572,1975,Papua New Guinea,to the extent that the law is reasonably justifiable in a democratic society having a proper respect for the rights and dignity of mankind.
8573,1975,Papua New Guinea,"2. For the purposes of Subsection (1), a law must-"
8574,1975,Papua New Guinea,a.be expressed to be a law that is made for that purpose; and
8575,1975,Papua New Guinea,b.specify the right or freedom that it regulates or restricts; and
8576,1975,Papua New Guinea,"c.be made, and certified by the Speaker in his certificate under Section 110 (certification as to making of laws) to have been made, by an absolute majority."
8577,1975,Papua New Guinea,3. The burden of showing that a law is a law that complies with the requirements of Subsection (1) is on the party relying on its validity.
8578,1975,Papua New Guinea,"39. REASONABLY JUSTIFIABLE IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY"", ETC"
8579,1975,Papua New Guinea,"1. The question, whether a law or act is reasonably justifiable in a democratic society having a proper regard for the rights and dignity of mankind, is to be determined in the light of the circumstances obtaining at the time when the decision on the question is made."
8580,1975,Papua New Guinea,"2. A law shall not be declared not to be reasonably justifiable in a society having a proper regard for the rights and dignity of mankind except by the Supreme Court or the National Court, or any other court prescribed for the purpose by or under an Act of the Parliament, and unless the court is satisfied that the law was never so justifiable such a declaration operates as a repeal of the law as at the date of the declaration."
8581,1975,Papua New Guinea,"3. For the purposes of determining whether or not any law, matter or thing is reasonably justified in a democratic society that has a proper regard for the rights and dignity of mankind, a court may have regard to-"
8582,1975,Papua New Guinea,"a.the provisions of this Constitution generally, and especially the National Goals and Directive Principles and the Basic Social Obligations; and"
8583,1975,Papua New Guinea,b.the Charter of the United Nations; and
8584,1975,Papua New Guinea,"c.the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and any other declaration, recommendation or decision of the General Assembly of the United Nations concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms; and"
8585,1975,Papua New Guinea,"d.the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Protocols thereto, and any other international conventions, agreements or declarations concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms; and"
8586,1975,Papua New Guinea,"e.judgements, reports and opinions of the International Court of Justice, the European Commission of Human Rights, the European Court of Human Rights and other international courts and tribunals dealing with human rights and fundamental freedoms; and"
8587,1975,Papua New Guinea,"f.previous laws, practices and judicial decisions and opinions in the country; and"
8588,1975,Papua New Guinea,"g.laws, practices and judicial decisions and opinions in other countries; and"
8589,1975,Papua New Guinea,"h.the Final Report of the pre-Independence Constitutional Planning Committee dated 13 August 1974 and presented to the pre-Independence House of Assembly on 16 August 1974, as affected by decisions of that House on the report and by decisions of the Constituent Assembly on the draft of this Constitution; and"
8590,1975,Papua New Guinea,i.declarations by the International Commission of Jurists and other similar organizations; and
8591,1975,Papua New Guinea,j.any other material that the court considers relevant.
8592,1975,Papua New Guinea,40. VALIDITY OF EMERGENCY LAWS
8593,1975,Papua New Guinea,"Nothing in this Part invalidates an emergency law as defined in Part X (emergency powers), but nevertheless so far as is consistent with their purposes and terms all such laws shall be interpreted and applied so as not to affect or derogate a right or freedom referred to in this Division to an extent that is more than is reasonably necessary to deal with the emergency concerned and matters arising out of it, but only so far as is reasonably justifiable in a democratic society having a proper regard for the rights and dignity of mankind."
8594,1975,Papua New Guinea,41. PROSCRIBED ACTS
8595,1975,Papua New Guinea,"1. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other provision of any law, any act that is done under a valid law but in the particular case-"
8596,1975,Papua New Guinea,a.is harsh or oppressive; or
8597,1975,Papua New Guinea,"b.is not warranted by, or is disproportionate to, the requirements of the particular circumstances or of the particular case; or"
8598,1975,Papua New Guinea,"c.is otherwise not, in the particular circumstances, reasonably justifiable in a democratic society having a proper regard for the rights and dignity of mankind,"
8599,1975,Papua New Guinea,is an unlawful act.
8600,1975,Papua New Guinea,"2. The burden of showing that Subsection (1)(a), (b) or (c) applies in respect of an act is on the party alleging it, and may be discharged on the balance of probabilities."
8601,1975,Papua New Guinea,3. Nothing in this section affects the operation of any other law under which an act may be held to be unlawful or invalid.
8602,1975,Papua New Guinea,RIGHTS OF ALL PERSONS
8603,1975,Papua New Guinea,42. LIBERTY OF THE PERSON
8604,1975,Papua New Guinea,1. No person shall be deprived of his personal liberty except-
8605,1975,Papua New Guinea,a.in consequence of his unfitness to plead to a criminal charge; or

8607,1975,Papua New Guinea,c.by reason of his failure to comply with the order of a court made to secure the fulfilment of an obligation (other than a contractual obligation) imposed upon him by law; or
8608,1975,Papua New Guinea,"d.upon reasonable suspicion of his having committed, or being about to commit, an offence; or"
8609,1975,Papua New Guinea,e.for the purpose of bringing him before a court in execution of the order of a court; or
8610,1975,Papua New Guinea,"f.for the purpose of preventing the introduction or spread of a disease or suspected disease, whether of humans, animals or plants, or for normal purposes of quarantine; or"
8611,1975,Papua New Guinea,"g.for the purpose of preventing the unlawful entry of a person into Papua New Guinea, or for the purpose of effecting the expulsion, extradition or other lawful removal of a person from Papua New Guinea, or the taking of proceedings for any of these purposes; or"
8612,1975,Papua New Guinea,"ga.for the purposes of holding a foreign national under arrangements made by Papua New Guinea with another country or with an international organisation that the Minister responsible for immigration matters, in his absolute discretion, approves; or*"
8613,1975,Papua New Guinea,*[this section was ruled invalid and therefore of no force or effect by the Supreme Court — SCA. NO. 84 OF 2013]
8614,1975,Papua New Guinea,"h.in the case of a person who is, or is reasonably suspected of being of unsound mind, or addicted to drugs or alcohol, or a vagrant, for the purposes of-"
8615,1975,Papua New Guinea,"i.his care or treatment or the protection of the community, under an order of a court; or"
8616,1975,Papua New Guinea,ii.taking prompt legal proceedings to obtain an order of a court of a type referred to in Subparagraph (i); and
8617,1975,Papua New Guinea,"i.in the case of a person who has not attained the age of 18 years, for the purpose of his education or welfare under the order of a court or with the consent of his guardian."
8618,1975,Papua New Guinea,2. A person who is arrested or detained-
8619,1975,Papua New Guinea,"a.shall be informed promptly, in a language that he understands, of the reasons for his arrest or detention and of any charge against him; and"
8620,1975,Papua New Guinea,"b.shall be permitted whenever practicable to communicate without delay and in private with a member of his family or a personal friend, and with a lawyer of his choice (including the Public Solicitor if he is entitled to legal aid); or"
8621,1975,Papua New Guinea,"c.shall be given adequate opportunity to give instructions to a lawyer of his choice in the place in which he is detained,"
8622,1975,Papua New Guinea,and shall be informed immediately on his arrest or detention of his rights under this subsection.
8623,1975,Papua New Guinea,3. A person who is arrested or detained-
8624,1975,Papua New Guinea,a.for the purpose of being brought before a court in the execution of an order of a court; or
8625,1975,Papua New Guinea,"b.upon reasonable suspicion of his having committed, or being about to commit, an offence,"
8626,1975,Papua New Guinea,"shall, unless he is released, be brought without delay before a court or a judicial officer and, in a case referred to in paragraph (b), shall not be further held in custody in connection with the offence except by order of a court or judicial officer."
8627,1975,Papua New Guinea,"4. The necessity or desirability of interrogating the person concerned or other persons, or any administrative requirement or convenience, is not a good ground for failing to comply with Subsection (3), but exigencies of travel which in the circumstances are reasonable may, without derogating any other protection available to the person concerned, be such a ground."
8628,1975,Papua New Guinea,5. Where complaint is made to the National Court or a Judge that a person is unlawfully or unreasonably detained-
8629,1975,Papua New Guinea,a.the National Court or a Judge shall inquire into the complaint and order the person concerned to be brought before it or him; and
8630,1975,Papua New Guinea,"b.unless the Court or Judge is satisfied that the detention is lawful, and in the case of a person being detained on remand pending his trial does not constitute an unreasonable detention having regard, in particular, to its length, the Court or a Judge shall order his release either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as the Court or Judge thinks fit."
8631,1975,Papua New Guinea,6. A person arrested or detained for an offence (other than treason or wilful murder as defined by an Act of the Parliament) is entitled to bail at all times from arrest or detention to acquittal or conviction unless the interests of justice otherwise require.
8632,1975,Papua New Guinea,7. Where a person to whom Subsection (6) applies is refused bail-
8633,1975,Papua New Guinea,"a.the court or person refusing bail shall, on request by the person concerned or his representative, state in writing the reason for the refusal; and"
8634,1975,Papua New Guinea,b.the person or his representative may apply to the Supreme Court or the National Court in a summary manner for his release.
8635,1975,Papua New Guinea,"8. Subject to any other law, nothing in this section applies in respect of any reasonable act of the parent or guardian of a child, or a person into whose care a child has been committed, in the course of the education, discipline or upbringing of the child."
8636,1975,Papua New Guinea,"9. Subject to any Constitutional Law or Act of the Parliament, nothing in this section applies in respect of a person who is in custody under the law of another country-"
8637,1975,Papua New Guinea,a.while in transit through the country; or
8638,1975,Papua New Guinea,b.as permitted by or under an Act of the Parliament made for the purposes of Section 206 (visiting forces).
8639,1975,Papua New Guinea,43. FREEDOM FROM FORCED LABOUR

8647,1975,Papua New Guinea,"f.labour of a reasonable amount and kind (including in the case of compulsory military service, labour required as an alternative to such service in the case of a person who has conscientious objections to military service) that is required in the national interest by an Organic Law that complies with Section 38 (general qualifications on qualified rights)."

8649,1975,Papua New Guinea,"No person shall be subjected to the search of his person or property or to entry of his premises, except to the extent that the exercise of that right is regulated or restricted by a law-"
8650,1975,Papua New Guinea,a.that makes reasonable provision for a search or entry-

11386,1975,Papua New Guinea,b.periods of temporary absence from that place shall not be counted as periods of residence in that place but otherwise do not affect the continuity of residence.

11439,1975,Papua New Guinea,c.in their application to any particular matter they are inconsistent with custom as adopted by Part I.
11440,1975,Papua New Guinea,"2. Subject to Subsection (1)(a), (b) and (c), the principles and rules adopted under Subsection (1) include principles and rules relating to the Royal Prerogative, except insofar as they provide for-"

11447,1975,Papua New Guinea,"SCH.2.3. DEVELOPMENT, ETC., OF THE UNDERLYING LAW"
11448,1975,Papua New Guinea,"1. If in any particular matter before a court there appears to be no rule of law that is applicable and appropriate to the circumstances of the country, it is the duty of the National Judicial System, and in particular of the Supreme Court and the National Court, to formulate an appropriate rule as part of the underlying law having regard-"
11449,1975,Papua New Guinea,"a.in particular, to the National Goals and Directive Principles and the Basic Social Obligations; and"
11450,1975,Papua New Guinea,b.to Division III.3 (basic rights); and
11451,1975,Papua New Guinea,c.to analogies to be drawn from relevant statutes and customs; and
11452,1975,Papua New Guinea,"d.to the legislation of, and to relevant decisions of the courts of, any country that in the opinion of the court has a legal system similar to that of Papua New Guinea; and"
11453,1975,Papua New Guinea,"e.to relevant decisions of courts exercising jurisdiction in or in respect of all or any part of the country at any time,"
11454,1975,Papua New Guinea,and to the circumstances of the country from time to time.
11455,1975,Papua New Guinea,"2. If in any court other than the Supreme Court a question arises that would involve the performance of the duty imposed by Subsection (1), then, unless the question is trivial, vexatious or irrelevant-"
11456,1975,Papua New Guinea,a.in the case of the National Court- the court may; and
11457,1975,Papua New Guinea,"b.in the case of any other court (not being a village court)the court shall,"
11458,1975,Papua New Guinea,"refer the matter for decision to the Supreme Court, and take whatever other action (including the adjournment of proceedings) is appropriate."
11459,1975,Papua New Guinea,SCH.2.4. JUDICIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNDERLYING LAW
11460,1975,Papua New Guinea,"In all cases, it is the duty of the National Judicial System, and especially of the Supreme Court and the National Court, to ensure that, with due regard to the need for consistency, the underlying law develops as a coherent system in a manner that is appropriate to the circumstances of the country from time to time, except insofar as it would not be proper to do so by judicial act."
11461,1975,Papua New Guinea,SCH.2.5. REPORTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNDERLYING LAW
11462,1975,Papua New Guinea,"In their reports under Section 187(1) (reports by Judges), and in any report under Section 187(2) (reports by Judges) if in their opinion it is desirable to do so, the Judges shall comment on the state, suitability and development of the underlying law, with any recommendations as to improvement that they think it proper to make."
11463,1975,Papua New Guinea,SCH.2.6. ADOPTION OF PRE-INDEPENDENCE LAW
11464,1975,Papua New Guinea,"1. In Subsection (2), ""pre-Independence law"" means-"
11465,1975,Papua New Guinea,"a.a law (including a law that had not yet come into operation) that was repealed by the Laws Repeal Act 1975 made by the pre-Independence House of Assembly for Papua New Guinea, and includes-"
11466,1975,Papua New Guinea,"i.a law that was, and to the extent that it was, continued in force under or by virtue of any such law; and"
11467,1975,Papua New Guinea,"ii.a purported law that might have been (but had not been declared by a court to be) invalid by reason of a failure to comply with any other law in respect of the manner of its assent,"
11468,1975,Papua New Guinea,"other than such a law that was repealed or superseded, or had expired or was spent, before the commencement of the Laws Repeal Act 1975; and"
11469,1975,Papua New Guinea,b.the laws of Australia specified in Part 1 of Schedule 5 as in force in the country immediately before Independence Day; and
11470,1975,Papua New Guinea,c.the laws of England specified in Part 2 of Schedule 5 as in force in the country immediately before Independence Day; and
11471,1975,Papua New Guinea,"d.subordinate legislative enactments under any such laws that were in force in the country immediately before the repeal, or immediately before Independence Day, as the case may be."
11472,1975,Papua New Guinea,"2. Subject to any Constitutional Law, all pre-Independence laws are, by virtue of this section, adopted as Acts of the Parliament, or subordinate legislative enactments under such Acts, as the case may be, and apply to the extent to which they applied, or purported to apply, immediately before the repeal referred to in Subsection (1)(a), or immediately before Independence Day, as the case may be."
11473,1975,Papua New Guinea,"3. For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that where a pre-Independence law to which Subsection (2) applies has not been brought into operation, and does not itself express a date on which it is to come into operation, it may be brought into operation-"
11474,1975,Papua New Guinea,a.in the case of an Acton a date to be fixed by the Head of State by notice published in the National Gazette; and
11475,1975,Papua New Guinea,b.in the case of a subordinate legislative enactment - by publication in the National Gazette.
11476,1975,Papua New Guinea,SCH.2.7. ADOPTION OF ADOPTED LAW
11477,1975,Papua New Guinea,"1. A law adopted by Section Sch.2.6 (adoption of pre-Independence laws) takes effect subject to such changes as to names, titles, offices, persons and institutions, and to such other formal and non-substantive changes, as are necessary to adapt it to the circumstances of the country and to the Constitutional Laws."
11478,1975,Papua New Guinea,"2. A Constitutional Regulation may prescribe changes to be made for the purposes of Subsection (1) and any such regulation is conclusive to the changes so prescribed, but no omission to prescribe a change affects the generality of that subsection."
11479,1975,Papua New Guinea,"3. A question as to a change to be made for the purposes of Subsection (1) is not a question relating to the interpretation or application of any provision of a Constitutional Law within the meaning of Section 18 (original interpretative jurisdiction of the Supreme Court), but this subsection does not affect the operation of Section 19 (special references to the Supreme Court)."
11480,1975,Papua New Guinea,PART 5. JUDICIAL PRECEDENT

11490,1975,Papua New Guinea,"1. All decisions of law by the Supreme Court are binding on all other courts, but not on itself."
11491,1975,Papua New Guinea,"2. Subject to Section Sch.2.10 (conflict of precedents), all decisions of law by the National Court are binding on all other courts (other than the Supreme Court), but not on itself (except insofar as a decision of the National Court constituted by more Judges than one is of greater authority than a decision of the Court constituted by a lesser number)."
11492,1975,Papua New Guinea,"3. Subject to this Part, all decisions of law by a court other than the Supreme Court or the National Court are binding on all lower courts."
11493,1975,Papua New Guinea,"4. In Subsection (4), ""lower court"", in relation to a matter before a court, means a court to which proceedings by way of appeal or review (whether by leave or as of right) lie from the first-mentioned court in relation to the matter."
11494,1975,Papua New Guinea,SCH.2.10. CONFLICT OF PRECEDENTS
