9401,1852,New Zealand,61A. INCIDENTAL ORDERS AND DIRECTIONS MAY BE MADE AND GIVEN BY 1 JUDGE
9402,1852,New Zealand,"1. In any civil appeal or in any civil proceeding before the Court of Appeal, any Judge of that court, sitting in chambers, may make such incidental orders and give such incidental directions as he thinks fit, not being an order or a direction that determines the appeal or disposes of any question or issue that is before the court in the appeal or proceeding."
9403,1852,New Zealand,"2. Every order or direction made or given by a Judge of the Court of Appeal under subsection (1) may be discharged or varied by any Judges of that court who together have jurisdiction, in accordance with section 58A or section 58B or section 58D, as the case may be, to hear and determine the proceeding."
9404,1852,New Zealand,"3. Any Judge of the Court of Appeal may review a decision of the Registrar made within the civil jurisdiction of the court under a power conferred on the Registrar by any rule of court, and may confirm, modify, or revoke that decision as he thinks fit."

9412,1852,New Zealand,SUBPART 1. REMOVAL OF PROCEEDINGS FROM THE HIGH COURT
9413,1852,New Zealand,64. TRANSFER OF CIVIL PROCEEDINGS FROM HIGH COURT TO COURT OF APPEAL
9414,1852,New Zealand,"1. If the circumstances of a civil proceeding pending before the High Court are exceptional, the High Court may order that the proceeding be transferred to the Court of Appeal."
9415,1852,New Zealand,"2. Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the circumstances of a proceeding may be exceptional if—"
9416,1852,New Zealand,a.a party to the proceeding intends to submit that a relevant decision of the Court of Appeal should be overruled by the Court of Appeal:
9417,1852,New Zealand,"b.the proceeding raises 1 or more issues of considerable public importance that need to be determined urgently, and those issues are unlikely to be determined urgently if the proceeding is heard and determined by both the High Court and the Court of Appeal:"
9418,1852,New Zealand,"c.the proceeding does not raise any question of fact or any significant question of fact, but does raise 1 or more questions of law that are the subject of conflicting decisions of the High Court."
9419,1852,New Zealand,"3. In deciding whether to transfer a proceeding under subsection (1), a Judge must have regard to the following matters:"
9420,1852,New Zealand,a.the primary purpose of the Court of Appeal as an appellate court:
9421,1852,New Zealand,b.the desirability of obtaining a determination at first instance and a review of that determination on appeal:
9422,1852,New Zealand,c.whether a full court of the High Court could effectively determine the question in issue:
9423,1852,New Zealand,d.whether the proceeding raises any question of fact or any significant question of fact:
9424,1852,New Zealand,e.whether the parties have agreed to the transfer of the proceeding to the Court of Appeal:
9425,1852,New Zealand,f.any other matter that the Judge considers that he or she should have regard to in the public interest.
9426,1852,New Zealand,4. The fact that the parties to a proceeding agree to the transfer of the proceeding to the Court of Appeal is not in itself a sufficient ground for an order transferring the proceeding.
9427,1852,New Zealand,"5. If the High Court transfers a proceeding under subsection (1), the Court of Appeal has the jurisdiction of the High Court to hear and determine the proceeding."

9436,1852,New Zealand,a.to the Court of Appeal; or
9437,1852,New Zealand,b.directly to the Supreme Court (in exceptional circumstances as provided for in section 14 of the Supreme Court Act 2003).
9438,1852,New Zealand,"2. An application under subsection (1) for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal must be made to the High Court or, if the High Court refuses leave, to the Court of Appeal."

Where a bill of indictment has been found in the High Court, or any inquisition has been found, or any criminal information been granted against any person for any crime, if it appears to the High Court on affidavit on the part of the accused or of the prosecutor that the case is one of extraordinary importance or difficulty, and that it is desirable that it should be tried before the Judges at bar, the High Court may grant a rule nisi, and, if no sufficient cause is shown, may make the same absolute for the removal of such indictment, inquisition, or information, and the proceedings thereon, into the Court of Appeal, and for the trial of the same at bar at the next or other sitting of such Court of Appeal, and may direct that a special or common jury, as the High Court thinks fit, be summoned from such jury district as the court directs to serve upon such trial; and such proceedings, as nearly as may be, shall thereupon be had as upon a trial at bar in England."
9448,1852,New Zealand,"2. The Court of Appeal shall have the same jurisdiction, authority, and power in respect thereof as the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court of Justice has in England in respect of a trial at bar."

9492,1852,New Zealand,"A co-surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor shall not be entitled to recover from any other co-surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor by the means aforesaid more than the just proportion to which, as between those parties themselves, such last-mentioned person is justly liable."

9529,1852,New Zealand,94A. RECOVERY OF PAYMENTS MADE UNDER MISTAKE OF LAW
9530,1852,New Zealand,"1. Subject to the provisions of this section, where relief in respect of any payment that has been made under mistake is sought in any court, whether in civil proceedings or by way of defence, set off, counterclaim, or otherwise, and that relief could be granted if the mistake was wholly one of fact, that relief shall not be denied by reason only that the mistake is one of law whether or not it is in any degree also one of fact."
9531,1852,New Zealand,"2. Nothing in this section shall enable relief to be given in respect of any payment made at a time when the law requires or allows, or is commonly understood to require or allow, the payment to be made or enforced, by reason only that the law is subsequently changed or shown not to have been as it was commonly understood to be at the time of the payment."

9533,1852,New Zealand,"Relief, whether under section 94A or in equity or otherwise, in respect of any payment made under mistake, whether of law or of fact, shall be denied wholly or in part if the person from whom relief is sought received the payment in good faith and has so altered his position in reliance on the validity of the payment that in the opinion of the court, having regard to all possible implications in respect of other persons, it is inequitable to grant relief, or to grant relief in full, as the case may be."

9665,1852,New Zealand,"In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires,—"
9666,1852,New Zealand,application for review means an application under subsection (1) of section 4
9667,1852,New Zealand,decision includes a determination or order
9668,1852,New Zealand,"licence includes any permit, warrant, authorisation, registration, certificate, approval, or similar form of authority required by law"
9669,1852,New Zealand,"person includes a corporation sole, and also a body of persons whether incorporated or not; and, in relation to the exercise, refusal to exercise, or proposed or purported exercise by any person of a statutory power of decision, includes a District Court, the Compensation Court, the Maori Land Court, and the Maori Appellate Court"
9670,1852,New Zealand,"statutory power means a power or right conferred by or under any Act or by or under the constitution or other instrument of incorporation, rules, or bylaws of any body corporate—"
9671,1852,New Zealand,"a.to make any regulation, rule, bylaw, or order, or to give any notice or direction having force as subordinate legislation; or"
9672,1852,New Zealand,b.to exercise a statutory power of decision; or
9673,1852,New Zealand,"c.to require any person to do or refrain from doing any act or thing that, but for such requirement, he would not be required by law to do or refrain from doing; or"

9675,1852,New Zealand,"e.to make any investigation or inquiry into the rights, powers, privileges, immunities, duties, or liabilities of any person"
9676,1852,New Zealand,"statutory power of decision means a power or right conferred by or under any Act, or by or under the constitution or other instrument of incorporation, rules, or bylaws of any body corporate, to make a decision deciding or prescribing or affecting—"

9678,1852,New Zealand,"b.the eligibility of any person to receive, or to continue to receive, a benefit or licence, whether he is legally entitled to it or not."
9679,1852,New Zealand,3A. JURISDICTION OF EMPLOYMENT COURT
9680,1852,New Zealand,"This Part is subject to the provisions of the Employment Relations Act 2000 relating to the jurisdiction of the Employment Court and High Court in respect of applications for review or proceedings for a writ or order of, or in the nature of, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, or for a declaration or injunction against any body constituted by, or any person acting pursuant to, the Employment Relations Act 2000."
9681,1852,New Zealand,4. APPLICATION FOR REVIEW
9682,1852,New Zealand,"1. On an application which may be called an application for review, the High Court may, notwithstanding any right of appeal possessed by the applicant in relation to the subject matter of the application, by order grant, in relation to the exercise, refusal to exercise, or proposed or purported exercise by any person of a statutory power, any relief that the applicant would be entitled to, in any 1 or more of the proceedings for a writ or order of or in the nature of mandamus, prohibition, or certiorari or for a declaration or injunction, against that person in any such proceedings."
9683,1852,New Zealand,"2. Where on an application for review the applicant is entitled to an order declaring that a decision made in the exercise of a statutory power of decision is unauthorised or otherwise invalid, the court may, instead of making such a declaration, set aside the decision."
9684,1852,New Zealand,"2A. Notwithstanding any rule of law to the contrary, it shall not be a bar to the grant of relief in proceedings for a writ or an order of or in the nature of certiorari or prohibition, or to the grant of relief on an application for review, that the person who has exercised, or is proposing to exercise, a statutory power was not under a duty to act judicially; but this subsection shall not be construed to enlarge or modify the grounds on which the court may treat an applicant as being entitled to an order of or in the nature of certiorari or prohibition under the foregoing provisions of this section."
9685,1852,New Zealand,"3. Where in any of the proceedings referred to in subsection (1) the court had, before the commencement of this Part, a discretion to refuse to grant relief on any grounds, it shall have the like discretion, on like grounds, to refuse to grant any relief on an application for review."
9686,1852,New Zealand,"4. Subsection (3) shall not apply to the discretion of the court, before the commencement of this Part, to refuse to grant relief in any of the said proceedings on the ground that the relief should have been sought in any other of the said proceedings."
9687,1852,New Zealand,"5. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this section, on an application for review in relation to the exercise, refusal to exercise, or purported exercise of a statutory power of decision the court if it is satisfied that the applicant is entitled to relief under subsection (1), may, in addition to or instead of granting any other relief under the foregoing provisions of this section, direct any person whose act or omission is the subject matter of the application to reconsider and determine, either generally or in respect of any specified matters, the whole or any part of any matter to which the application relates. In giving any such direction the court shall—"
9688,1852,New Zealand,a.advise the person of its reasons for so doing; and
9689,1852,New Zealand,b.give to him such directions as it thinks just as to the reconsideration or otherwise of the whole or any part of the matter that is referred back for reconsideration.
9690,1852,New Zealand,"5A. If the court gives a direction under subsection (5) it may make any order that it could make by way of interim order under section 8, and that section shall apply accordingly, so far as it is applicable and with all necessary modifications."
9691,1852,New Zealand,"5B. Where any matter is referred back to any person under subsection (5), that person shall have jurisdiction to reconsider and determine the matter in accordance with the court’s direction notwithstanding anything in any other enactment."
9692,1852,New Zealand,"5C. Where any matter is referred back to any person under subsection (5), the act or omission that is to be reconsidered shall, subject to any interim order made by the court under subsection (5A), continue to have effect according to its tenor unless and until it is revoked or amended by that person."
9693,1852,New Zealand,6. In reconsidering any matter referred back to him under subsection (5) the person to whom it is so referred shall have regard to the court’s reasons for giving the direction and to the court’s directions.
9694,1852,New Zealand,"5. DEFECTS IN FORM, OR TECHNICAL IRREGULARITIES"
9695,1852,New Zealand,"On an application for review in relation to a statutory power of decision, where the sole ground of relief established is a defect in form or a technical irregularity, if the court finds that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred, it may refuse relief and, where the decision has already been made, may make an order validating the decision, notwithstanding the defect or irregularity, to have effect from such time and on such terms as the court thinks fit."
9696,1852,New Zealand,"6. DISPOSAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MANDAMUS, PROHIBITION, OR CERTIORARI"
9697,1852,New Zealand,"Where proceedings are commenced for a writ or order of or in the nature of mandamus, prohibition, or certiorari, in relation to the exercise, refusal to exercise, or proposed or purported exercise of a statutory power, the proceedings shall be treated and disposed of as if they were an application for review."
9698,1852,New Zealand,7. DISPOSAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECLARATION OR INJUNCTION
9699,1852,New Zealand,"Where proceedings are commenced for a declaration or injunction, or both, whether with or without a claim for other relief, and the exercise, refusal to exercise, or proposed or purported exercise of a statutory power is an issue in the proceedings, the court on the application of any party to the proceedings may, if it considers it appropriate, direct that the proceedings be treated and disposed of, so far as they relate to that issue, as if they were an application for review."
9700,1852,New Zealand,8. INTERIM ORDERS
9701,1852,New Zealand,"1. Subject to subsection (2), at any time before the final determination of an application for review, and on the application of any party, the court may, if in its opinion it is necessary to do so for the purpose of preserving the position of the applicant, make an interim order for all or any of the following purposes:"
9702,1852,New Zealand,a.prohibiting any respondent to the application for review from taking any further action that is or would be consequential on the exercise of the statutory power:
9703,1852,New Zealand,"b.prohibiting or staying any proceedings, civil or criminal, in connection with any matter to which the application for review relates:"
9704,1852,New Zealand,"c.declaring any licence that has been revoked or suspended in the exercise of the statutory power, or that will expire by effluxion of time before the final determination of the application for review, to continue and, where necessary, to be deemed to have continued in force."
9705,1852,New Zealand,"2. Where the Crown is the respondent (or one of the respondents) to the application for review the court shall not have power to make any order against the Crown under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b); but, instead, in any such case the court may, by interim order,—"
9706,1852,New Zealand,a.declare that the Crown ought not to take any further action that is or would be consequential on the exercise of the statutory power:
9707,1852,New Zealand,"b.declare that the Crown ought not to institute or continue with any proceedings, civil or criminal, in connection with any matter to which the application for review relates."
9708,1852,New Zealand,"3. Any order under subsection (1) or subsection (2) may be made subject to such terms and conditions as the court thinks fit, and may be expressed to continue in force until the application for review is finally determined or until such other date, or the happening of such other event, as the court may specify."
9709,1852,New Zealand,9. PROCEDURE

The person whose act or omission is the subject matter of the application for review, and, subject to any direction given by a Judge under section 10, every party to the proceedings (if any) in which any decision to which the application relates was made, shall be cited as a respondent."
9717,1852,New Zealand,"4A. For the purposes of subsection (4), where the act or omission is that of a Judge, Registrar, or presiding officer of any court or tribunal,—"
9718,1852,New Zealand,"a.that court or tribunal, and not that Judge, Registrar, or presiding officer, shall be cited as a respondent; but"
9719,1852,New Zealand,"b.that Judge, Registrar, or presiding officer may file, on behalf of that court or tribunal, a statement of defence to the statement of claim."
9720,1852,New Zealand,"5. For the purposes of subsection (4), where the act or omission is that of any 2 or more persons acting together under a collective title, they shall be cited by their collective title."

9724,1852,New Zealand,"1. For the purpose of ensuring that any application or intended application for review may be determined in a convenient and expeditious manner, and that all matters in dispute may be effectively and completely determined, a Judge may at any time, either on the application of any party or intended party or without any such application, and on such terms as he thinks fit, direct the holding of a conference of parties or intended parties or their counsel presided over by a Judge."
9725,1852,New Zealand,2. At any such conference the Judge presiding may—
9726,1852,New Zealand,a.settle the issues to be determined:
9727,1852,New Zealand,"b.direct what persons shall be cited, or need not be cited, as respondents to the application for review, or direct that the name of any party be added or struck out:"

9922,1852,New Zealand,recommend to the Minister within the meaning of section 4 of the Cadastral Survey Act 2002 that that land or that part of that land or that interest in land be no longer subject to resumption under section 27B of the State-Owned Enterprises Act 1986 or section 212 of the Education Act 1989; or

9924,1852,New Zealand,"3. In deciding whether to recommend the return to Maori ownership of any land or interest in land to which this section applies, the Tribunal shall not have regard to any changes that, since immediately before the date of the transfer of the land or interest in land from the Crown to a State enterprise, or an institution within the meaning of section 159 of the Education Act 1989, have taken place in—"
9925,1852,New Zealand,a.the condition of the land or of the land in which the interest exists and any improvements to it; or

9930,1852,New Zealand,a.an interest in land which was in existence immediately before the land was transferred to the State enterprise under section 23 of the State-Owned Enterprises Act 1986 or vested in the State enterprise by a notice in the Gazette under section 24 of that Act or by an Order in Council made under section 28 of that Act but which was not so transferred to or vested in the State enterprise; or

9932,1852,New Zealand,"as the case may be, no recommendation under this section shall relate to that interest in land."
9933,1852,New Zealand,8B. INTERIM RECOMMENDATIONS IN RESPECT OF LAND TRANSFERRED TO OR VESTED IN STATE ENTERPRISE
9934,1852,New Zealand,"1. Where the recommendations made by the Tribunal include a recommendation made under section 8A(2)(a) or section 8A(2)(b), all of those recommendations shall be in the first instance interim recommendations."

9939,1852,New Zealand,"b.shall, within 90 days after the date of the making of the interim recommendations, inform the Tribunal—"
9940,1852,New Zealand,i.whether the party accepts or has implemented the interim recommendations; and
9941,1852,New Zealand,"ii.if the party has made an offer under paragraph (a), the result of that offer."
9942,1852,New Zealand,"5.

9943,1852,New Zealand,"6. If subsection (5) does not apply in relation to any interim recommendations that include a recommendation made under section 8A(2)(a) or section 8A(2)(b), upon the expiration of the 90th day after the date of the making of the interim recommendations, the interim recommendations shall take effect as final recommendations."
9944,1852,New Zealand,"7. Notwithstanding anything in subsections (1) to (6), if any interim recommendations contain a clerical mistake or an error arising from any accidental slip or omission, whether the mistake, error, slip, or omission was made by an officer of the Tribunal or not, or if any interim recommendations are so drawn up as not to express what was actually decided and intended, the interim recommendations may be corrected by the Tribunal, either of its own motion or on the application of any party."
9945,1852,New Zealand,"8. Where the interim recommendations are corrected under subsection (7),—"
9946,1852,New Zealand,a.the Tribunal shall cause copies of the corrected interim recommendations to be served on the parties to the inquiry as soon as practicable; and
9947,1852,New Zealand,"b.the period that applies for the purposes of subsections (3), (4), and (6) shall expire on the 90th day after the date of the making of the corrected interim recommendations."
9948,1852,New Zealand,8C. RIGHT TO BE HEARD ON QUESTION IN RELATION TO LAND TRANSFERRED TO OR VESTED IN STATE ENTERPRISE

10257,1852,New Zealand,"3. The fact that any person holding office as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary in respect of any Ministerial office purports to exercise or perform any function, duty, or power of the Minister concerned shall be conclusive evidence of that person’s authority to do so."

11128,1852,New Zealand,c.whose name has been subsequently removed from that electoral roll through no fault or failure of that person.
11129,1852,New Zealand,"2. A person is not, by reason only of his or her name having been removed from an electoral roll, disqualified from becoming a candidate and being elected as a member of Parliament."
11130,1852,New Zealand,"3. However, a person who consents to his or her nomination as a candidate must make a statutory declaration declaring that—"

11150,1852,New Zealand,4. Where the employer of any State servant is satisfied that the State servant desires to become a candidate and that the candidacy will materially affect the ability of that State servant—
11151,1852,New Zealand,a.to carry out satisfactorily his or her duties as a State servant; or
11152,1852,New Zealand,"b.to be seen as independent in relation to particular duties,—"
11153,1852,New Zealand,"the period of leave shall, if the employer so determines after consultation with the State servant, commence before nomination day on a day appointed by the employer."
11154,1852,New Zealand,"5. During the period of his or her leave, the State servant shall not be required or permitted to carry out any of his or her official duties, nor shall he or she be entitled to receive any salary or other remuneration as a State servant in respect of that period or any part thereof, except to the extent to which he or she takes during that period any leave with pay to which he or she is entitled:"

Where a person who has been declared elected as the result of a poll is not the person declared elected on an amended declaration of the result of that poll or where, at the conclusion of the trial of an election petition, the High Court or Court of Appeal determines that the person whose election or return was complained of was not duly elected or returned or that the election at which that person was elected or returned was void, that person,—"

11532,1852,New Zealand,a.the definition of electoral roll in section 3(1); and
11533,1852,New Zealand,"b.sections 89A, 98, and 103."
11534,1852,New Zealand,9. A Maori who receives a notice sent under subsection (2) but who does not exercise the option given by section 76(1) in the option period continues to be registered on the roll as an elector of the electoral district in which he or she is currently registered.
11535,1852,New Zealand,"10. If a notice returned to a Registrar under subsection (5)(a) is received by the Registrar by post after the end of the option period but not later than noon on the day after the last day of that period, the notice is deemed to have been received in that option period, and the elector must, if the notice is otherwise in order, be deemed to have exercised the option given by section 76(1) in that option period."
11536,1852,New Zealand,"11. If a notice returned to a Registrar under subsection (5)(a) is received by the Registrar within the option period but that notice does not comply with the requirements for signing and dating, the Registrar may treat the notice as being in accordance with those requirements before the end of that option period if the non-compliance is remedied within 6 days after the end of that option period."

11625,1852,New Zealand,87. PROCEDURE IF IMMIGRATION STATUS MEANS APPLICANT APPARENTLY NOT QUALIFIED TO BE REGISTERED
11626,1852,New Zealand,1. This section applies in accordance with section 263A(6)(a) if the Electoral Commission under section 263A(5) advises the Registrar of an electoral district that a comparison carried out pursuant to section 263A(4) indicates that a person who has applied to be (but is not yet) registered as an elector of the electoral district is a person who the chief executive of the responsible department (as defined in section 263A(1)) believes is—
11627,1852,New Zealand,a.unlawfully in New Zealand; or
11628,1852,New Zealand,b.a person who is lawfully in New Zealand but only by virtue of being the holder of a temporary entry class visa of whatever type.
11629,1852,New Zealand,2. When this section applies the Registrar must comply with subsections (3) to (5) before determining under section 87 whether the applicant for registration as an elector is qualified to be registered.
11630,1852,New Zealand,"3. The Registrar must within 5 working days of receiving that advice deliver to the applicant for registration personally, or send by post to that person, a written notice (in this section referred to as a or the notice) communicating—"
11631,1852,New Zealand,a.the advice that the Registrar received under section 263A(5) in respect of the applicant; and
11632,1852,New Zealand,b.that the Registrar may determine that the applicant’s immigration status means that the applicant is not qualified to be registered as an elector if information to the contrary is not made available to the Registrar by or on behalf of the applicant within 5 working days after the applicant receives the notice.
11633,1852,New Zealand,"4. If no response to the notice is made to the Registrar by or on behalf of the applicant within 10 working days of the notice being delivered to the applicant personally, or sent by post to that person, the Registrar must promptly deliver to the applicant for registration personally, or send by post to that person, a written notice (in this section referred to as a or the further notice) communicating—"
11634,1852,New Zealand,a.the advice that the Registrar received under section 263A(5) in respect of the applicant; and

11636,1852,New Zealand,c.that the Registrar may determine that the applicant’s immigration status means that the applicant is not qualified to be registered as an elector if information to the contrary is not made available to the Registrar by or on behalf of the applicant within 5 working days after the applicant receives the further notice.
11637,1852,New Zealand,5. The Registrar may determine under section 87 whether the applicant for registration as an elector is qualified to be registered only—
11638,1852,New Zealand,"a.after considering any response to the notice or a further notice made to the Registrar by or on behalf of the applicant within 5 working days after the notice or a further notice was delivered to the applicant personally, or received by that person by post; or"
11639,1852,New Zealand,"b.if no response to a further notice is made to the Registrar by or on behalf of the applicant within 10 working days of the further notice being delivered personally to the applicant, or received by that person by post."
11640,1852,New Zealand,6. A notice or further notice purportedly sent to the applicant by post—
11641,1852,New Zealand,"a.is, in the absence of proof to the contrary, treated as having been received by that person by post on the fourth working day after the day on which it is sent by post; and"
11642,1852,New Zealand,b.is treated as sent by post to that person on a day if it is proved to have been properly addressed to that person and to have been submitted on that day to a person for the time being registered as a postal operator under the Postal Services Act 1998 for postage to that person.
11643,1852,New Zealand,"7. If, after complying with subsections (3) to (5), the Registrar determines under section 87 that the applicant for registration as an elector is not qualified to be registered, the Registrar must deliver to the applicant for registration personally, or send by post to that person, a written notice communicating the determination."
11644,1852,New Zealand,88. APPLICATIONS RECEIVED AFTER ISSUE OF WRIT
11645,1852,New Zealand,"1.

11646,1852,New Zealand,"2. For the purposes of subsection (1), an application for registration shall be deemed to have been received before polling day if—"
11647,1852,New Zealand,a.the application or the envelope in which it is contained bears a postmark or date stamp impressed at any New Zealand Post outlet or agency before polling day; or
11648,1852,New Zealand,b.the applicant for registration produces a receipt which relates to the application and which was issued by any New Zealand Post outlet or agency before polling day.
11649,1852,New Zealand,c.[Repealed]
11650,1852,New Zealand,"3. Where any person applies for registration after a writ has been issued requiring the conduct of an election in a district and before polling day,—"
11651,1852,New Zealand,"a.the Registrar shall, if the Registrar is satisfied that that person is qualified to be registered, forthwith enter the name of that person on the electoral roll; and"
11652,1852,New Zealand,b.the Registrar shall not be required to enter the name of that person on the main roll or any supplementary roll or composite roll used at that election; and

11656,1852,New Zealand,"2. Where it appears to the Registrar that an applicant who is a Maori is prevented, by the manner in which he or she last exercised the option given by section 76, from being registered as an elector of the district to which his or her application relates, the Registrar shall forthwith send the application to the Registrar of the district in respect of which the applicant is entitled to be registered and shall notify the elector of his or her reasons for refusing the application and of the Registrar to whom the application has been sent."
11657,1852,New Zealand,"3. Where an application for registration as an elector has been received before the issue of a writ and it has not been possible for the Registrar to ascertain, at the time of the issue of the writ, whether the applicant is currently registered as an elector of another electoral district, the Registrar shall, subject to subsection (4), include the name of the applicant on any main, supplementary, or composite roll printed as at writ day."
11658,1852,New Zealand,"4. Notwithstanding anything in this Act, where the Registrar has, under subsection (3), included the name of any person on any main, supplementary, or composite roll printed as at writ day, the Registrar shall, within 6 days after writ day determine, either—"
11659,1852,New Zealand,a.to enter the name of the applicant on the electoral roll; or
11660,1852,New Zealand,"b.to delete the name of the applicant from that main, supplementary, or composite roll."

Despite subsection (6), an elector who gives notice of the matters specified in subsection (2) after the expiry of the period referred to in that subsection but before the commencement of a prosecution is not liable for prosecution for his or her earlier failure to give notice."

13034,1852,New Zealand,ii.all records of special votes exercised; and

If on that comparison or from the checking of declarations in respect of special votes or from the report of a manager of a polling place on the ballot papers set aside under section 171, and after any inquiry the Returning Officer considers necessary, it appears that the same voter has received more than 1 ballot paper, the Returning Officer must,—"
13041,1852,New Zealand,"a.in the presence of any assistants and any scrutineers that choose to be present, but of no other person, open the parcel or parcels of ballot papers that are likely to contain the ballot papers issued to the voter; and"

13047,1852,New Zealand,the Returning Officer shall allow the vote of that voter and shall disallow the other vote or votes.
13048,1852,New Zealand,"4. If, on the comparison with all the certified copies of the main roll and supplementary rolls on which the fact of any person having received a ballot paper has been noted, and all records of special votes exercised in respect of the district, and the list of post-writ day deletions, it appears that any person has received a ballot paper by giving a name shown on the list of post-writ day deletions, the Returning Officer—"
13049,1852,New Zealand,"a.must, in the presence of any assistants and any scrutineers that choose to be present, but of no other person, open the parcel or parcels of ballot papers that are likely to contain the ballot papers issued to the voter; and"

13053,1852,New Zealand,"6. Notwithstanding subsections (4) and (5), if—"
13054,1852,New Zealand,a.the Returning Officer is satisfied that the name by which a ballot paper selected under subsection (4)(b) was received was entered on the list of post-writ day deletions by mistake or clerical error or as a result of false information; and
13055,1852,New Zealand,b.more than 1 ballot paper was received by the giving of a name shown on the list of post-writ day deletions; and
13056,1852,New Zealand,c.the Returning Officer is satisfied—
13057,1852,New Zealand,i.that 1 and only 1 of the ballot papers was lawfully received by the voter entitled thereto; and
13058,1852,New Zealand,"ii.that the voter entitled thereto was not in any way concerned in the issue of the other ballot paper or ballot papers,—"

13064,1852,New Zealand,"2. The Returning Officer shall set aside all ballot papers selected by him or her from any parcel as herein provided, and shall in the presence of his or her assistants (if any) and such scrutineers as are present, but of no other person, secure those ballot papers in a separate parcel, and shall endorse the parcel with a description of the contents thereof, and shall sign the endorsement with his or her name."

13068,1852,New Zealand,"2. The procedure set out in subsection (1) need not be delayed until the inquiries under section 176(2), or the inquiries as to the qualifications of persons casting a special vote at the election, have been completed, and the ballot papers from any particular polling place may be counted while any inquiries in respect of ballot papers from that place or in respect of the qualifications of persons casting a special vote at the election are being completed, but the count shall not be completed until those inquiries have been completed."
13069,1852,New Zealand,"3. No special vote shall be disallowed by reason only of some error or omission on the part of an official, if the Returning Officer is satisfied that the voter was qualified to vote at the election."
13070,1852,New Zealand,"4. Where a person who has voted in an election dies before the close of the day before polling day, the Returning Officer shall, on receiving from a Registrar of Births and Deaths notification of that person’s death, disallow that person’s vote."
13071,1852,New Zealand,"5. When the parcel selected under subsection (1) has been opened, the Returning Officer shall, in the presence of his or her assistants (if any) and the scrutineers and Justice as aforesaid, but of no other person, deal with the ballot papers as follows:"
13072,1852,New Zealand,a.he or she shall reject as informal—
13073,1852,New Zealand,i.any ballot paper that does not bear the official mark if there is reasonable cause to believe that it was not issued to a voter by an issuing officer; and
13074,1852,New Zealand,"ii.a ballot paper that does not clearly indicate the constituency candidate or the party, as the case may require, for which the voter desired to vote:"
13075,1852,New Zealand,"provided that no ballot paper or part of the ballot paper shall be rejected as informal by reason only of some informality in the manner in which it or any other part of the ballot paper has been dealt with by the voter if the ballot paper or part of the ballot paper being considered is otherwise regular, and if, in the opinion of the Returning Officer, the intention of the voter is clearly indicated:"
13076,1852,New Zealand,"provided also that no ballot paper or part of a ballot paper shall be rejected as informal by reason only of some error or omission on the part of an official, if the Returning Officer is satisfied that the voter was qualified to vote at the election:"
13077,1852,New Zealand,b.the Returning Officer shall then—
13078,1852,New Zealand,"i.count, as the case may require, the number of votes received by each party or the number of votes received by each constituency candidate or both; and"
13079,1852,New Zealand,ii.count the number of party votes rejected as informal; and
13080,1852,New Zealand,iii.count the number of electorate votes rejected as informal; and
13081,1852,New Zealand,iv.compare the results of the counts conducted under subparagraphs (i) to (iii) with the certificate of the Deputy Returning Officer in respect of the preliminary count; and
13082,1852,New Zealand,"c.the Returning Officer shall then, where necessary, amend the certificate of the polling place manager in respect of the preliminary count; and every such certificate shall be initialled by the Returning Officer and the Justice attending:"
13083,1852,New Zealand,d.the Returning Officer must then endorse on the parcel the name or other identifier of the polling place where the votes were recorded; and that endorsement must be signed by the Returning Officer and the Justice who attends.
13084,1852,New Zealand,"5A. Despite section 60, if a voter who was qualified to vote as an elector of a particular district votes as if he or she were an elector of another district, the voter’s party vote—"
13085,1852,New Zealand,a.may not be disallowed simply because of the voter’s error with regard to the district; and
13086,1852,New Zealand,"b.for the purposes of this section and sections 179 to 181, is to be regarded as having been cast by an elector of the other district."
13087,1852,New Zealand,6. The ballot papers from all the parcels shall be dealt with in the manner aforesaid and the ballot papers from one parcel may be so dealt with while those from another parcel or parcels are also being so dealt with.

13204,1852,New Zealand,SUBPART 21. LIST SEATS
13205,1852,New Zealand,191. ELECTION OF OTHER MEMBERS
13206,1852,New Zealand,"1. When the Electoral Commission has received from all Returning Officers the information required by section 179(1) to be forwarded to the Electoral Commission, the Electoral Commission must proceed to determine which of the candidates whose names have been included in party lists submitted pursuant to section 127 have been elected."
13207,1852,New Zealand,2. The Electoral Commission must first ascertain from the information given under section 179(1)(a) the total number of all the party votes received by each of the parties listed on the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote.
13208,1852,New Zealand,3. The Electoral Commission must enter those totals in separate columns under the name of each party in a working sheet in the manner prescribed in form 15.
13209,1852,New Zealand,4. The Electoral Commission must disregard any total under the name of any party that—
13210,1852,New Zealand,a.has not achieved a total that is at least 5% of the total number of all the party votes received by all the parties listed on the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote; and
13211,1852,New Zealand,b.is a party in respect of which no constituency candidate who is either—
13212,1852,New Zealand,i.a candidate for that party; or
13213,1852,New Zealand,"ii.a candidate for a component party of that party (being a component party that is not listed on the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote but is, in accordance with the details held by the Electoral Commission under any of the provisions of sections 127(3A) and 128A, a component party of that party)— has had his or her name endorsed on the writ pursuant to section 185 as a person declared to be elected as a member of Parliament."
13214,1852,New Zealand,"4A. Where the Electoral Commission disregards the name of a party in accordance with subsection (4), that party shall, for the purpose of this section and sections 192 and 193, be deemed to have been deleted from the list of parties included in the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote."
13215,1852,New Zealand,"5. The Electoral Commission must then proceed to divide each of the remaining totals successively by a series of numbers beginning with 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and thereafter by every odd number as may be necessary to ensure that the number of seats required to be allocated by this section and sections 192 and 193 are allocated."
13216,1852,New Zealand,6. The quotient of each successive division shall be recorded on the working sheet.
13217,1852,New Zealand,"7. Once the quotient of each successive division is entered on the working sheet, the Electoral Commission must then proceed to ascertain from a comparison of all the figures in the working sheet in form 15 listed under the heading “Quotients of divisions”, the highest 120 quotients or such lower number as is required by subsection (8)."
13218,1852,New Zealand,"8. If any person whose name is endorsed on the writ pursuant to section 185 as a person declared to be elected as a member of Parliament, is—"
13219,1852,New Zealand,a.an independent; or
13220,1852,New Zealand,"b.a member of a political party that did not appear on the list of parties in that part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote (not being a political party that is, in accordance with the details held by the Electoral Commission under any of the provisions of sections 127(3A) and 128A, a component party of a political party that did appear on that list),—"
13221,1852,New Zealand,"the Electoral Commission must, for the purposes of applying subsection (7), deduct from the number of 120 the number of any such persons."
13222,1852,New Zealand,"9. In any case where the lowest of the numbers required to be ascertained under subsection (7) constitutes 2 or more numbers in different columns which are of exactly the same value, the Electoral Commission must determine by lot which of those numbers is to be selected for the purpose of subsection (7)."
13223,1852,New Zealand,"10. The Electoral Commission, having ascertained the numbers required by subsection (7), must cause a circle to be drawn on the working sheet around each of those numbers."
13224,1852,New Zealand,192. DETERMINATION OF PARTY ELIGIBILITY FOR LIST SEATS
13225,1852,New Zealand,"1. Having ascertained the numbers required by section 191(7), the Electoral Commission must then proceed to ascertain the number of seats in Parliament to which each remaining party listed in the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote is entitled by adding the number of circles in the column of numbers under the name of that party."
13226,1852,New Zealand,"2. Subject to subsection (3), the Electoral Commission must then proceed, in respect of each remaining party listed in the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote, to deduct from the number of seats to which each party is entitled under subsection (1)—"
13227,1852,New Zealand,a.the number of persons who stood as constituency candidates for that party and whose names were endorsed on the writ pursuant to section 185 as having been elected as members of Parliament; and
13228,1852,New Zealand,"b.the number of persons who stood as constituency candidates for a party that is, in accordance with the details held by the Electoral Commission under any of the provisions of sections 127(3A) and 128A, a component party of that party and whose names were endorsed on a writ pursuant to section 185 as having been elected as members of Parliament."
13229,1852,New Zealand,3. The deduction described in subsection (2)(b) shall not be made in respect of constituency seats gained by a component party that is listed on the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote.
13230,1852,New Zealand,"4. Subject to subsection (5), after the process of deduction described in subsection (2) has been completed in respect of each party, the remainder derived therefrom shall be the number of seats to be allocated to that party from the list of candidates submitted pursuant to section 127."
13231,1852,New Zealand,"5. If any party listed in the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote has obtained, through the election of any of its constituency candidates or any of the constituency candidates for any party that is, in accordance with the details held by the Electoral Commission under any of the provisions of sections 127(3A) and 128A, a component party of that party or both, a number of seats that is equal to or greater than the total number of seats in Parliament to which it would be entitled under subsection (1), that party shall not be allocated any seats from the list of candidates submitted by that party pursuant to section 127, but the seats of the constituency candidates of that party who have been elected as members of Parliament shall not be affected."
13232,1852,New Zealand,193. SELECTION OF CANDIDATES
13233,1852,New Zealand,"1. Upon completing the procedures outlined in section 192, the Electoral Commission must proceed to determine which of the candidates whose names appear on the list submitted pursuant to section 127 by each of the parties listed in the part of the ballot paper that relates to the party vote are entitled to be elected."
13234,1852,New Zealand,"2. The Electoral Commission must determine which candidates are entitled to be elected by selecting those candidates on the list of each party, beginning with the first candidate on the list and ending with the lowest ranking candidate, which are equal in number to the number of seats to which that party is entitled to have allocated from its list submitted pursuant to section 127."

14547,1852,New Zealand,"if the court is satisfied that the election was so conducted as to be substantially in compliance with the law as to elections, and that the failure, omission, irregularity, want, defect, absence, mistake, or breach did not affect the result of the election."
14548,1852,New Zealand,242. DECISION OF COURT TO BE FINAL
14549,1852,New Zealand,"All decisions of the High Court under this Part shall be final and conclusive and without appeal, and shall not be questioned in any way."
14550,1852,New Zealand,243. CERTIFICATE OF COURT AS TO RESULT OF ELECTION
14551,1852,New Zealand,"At the conclusion of the trial of an election petition to which section 229(3) applies, the court shall determine whether the member whose election or return is complained of, or any and what other person, was duly elected or returned, or whether the election was void, and shall forthwith certify in writing the determination to the Speaker, and the determination so certified shall be final to all intents and purposes."
14552,1852,New Zealand,243A. ORDERS TO BE MADE BY COURT AFTER DETERMINATION UNDER SECTION 243 IF LIST SEATS ALLOCATED
14553,1852,New Zealand,"1. This section applies if, at the conclusion of the trial of an election petition,—"
14554,1852,New Zealand,"a.the court determines, under section 243, that the candidate who was duly elected was not declared elected under section 179(2) and the candidate who was declared elected under section 179(2) was not duly elected; and"
14555,1852,New Zealand,b.an allocation of seats by the Electoral Commission under sections 191 to 193 has been made.
14556,1852,New Zealand,"2. If this section applies, the court must—"
14557,1852,New Zealand,a.make an order that any declaration of election made pursuant to section 193(5) is invalid so far as it relates to the election of any specified candidate and that the election of any specified candidate is void; and
14558,1852,New Zealand,b.order that the Electoral Commission repeat any or all of the procedures prescribed by sections 191 to 193 and make a further declaration under section 193(5); and

14561,1852,New Zealand,244. REPORT OF COURT AS TO CORRUPT OR ILLEGAL PRACTICES
14562,1852,New Zealand,"1. Where, in an election petition to which section 229(3) applies, any charge is made of any corrupt or illegal practice having been committed at the election, the court shall, in addition to giving a certificate and at the same time, report in writing to the Speaker as follows:"
14563,1852,New Zealand,"a.whether any corrupt or illegal practice has or has not been proved to have been committed by or with the knowledge and consent of any constituency candidate at the election, and the nature of the corrupt or illegal practice:"
14564,1852,New Zealand,b.whether any of the constituency candidates has been guilty by his or her agents of any corrupt or illegal practice in reference to the election:
14565,1852,New Zealand,c.the names of all persons proved at the trial to have been guilty of any corrupt or illegal practice and whether they have received certificates of indemnity:
14566,1852,New Zealand,d.whether there is reason to believe that corrupt or illegal practices have extensively prevailed at the election.
14567,1852,New Zealand,"2. In the case of someone who is not a party to the petition nor a constituency candidate on behalf of whom the seat is claimed by the petition, the court, before reporting him or her to have been proved guilty of any corrupt or illegal practice, shall first cause notice to be given to him or her, and if he or she appears in pursuance of the notice, shall give him or her an opportunity of being heard and of calling evidence in his or her defence to show why he or she should not be so reported."
14568,1852,New Zealand,"3. For the purposes of this Act, if it is reported by the court that a corrupt or illegal practice was committed with the knowledge and consent of a constituency candidate, he or she shall be treated as having been reported to have been proved guilty of that corrupt or illegal practice."
14569,1852,New Zealand,"4. If a constituency candidate is reported to have been guilty by his or her agents of treating, undue influence, or any illegal practice, and the court further reports—"
14570,1852,New Zealand,"a.that no corrupt or illegal practice was committed at the election by the constituency candidate with his or her knowledge or consent, and that the offences mentioned in the report were committed without the sanction or connivance of the constituency candidate; and"
14571,1852,New Zealand,b.that all reasonable means for preventing the commission of corrupt and illegal practices at the election were taken by and on behalf of the constituency candidate; and
14572,1852,New Zealand,"c.that the offences mentioned in the report were of a trivial, unimportant, and limited character; and"
14573,1852,New Zealand,"d.that in all other respects the election was free from any corrupt or illegal practice on the part of the constituency candidate and of his or her agents,—"
14574,1852,New Zealand,the constituency candidate shall not be treated for the purposes of this Act as having been reported to have been proved guilty of the offences mentioned in the report.
14575,1852,New Zealand,245. SPECIAL REPORT
14576,1852,New Zealand,"At the same time as the court gives its certificate at the conclusion of the trial of an election petition to which section 229(3) applies, the court may make a special report to the Speaker as to any matters arising in the course of the trial an account of which, in the judgment of the court, ought to be submitted to the House of Representatives."

14578,1852,New Zealand,1. The certificate and any report of the court at the conclusion of the trial of an election petition shall be signed by at least 2 of the Judges presiding at the trial.

14583,1852,New Zealand,"1. Witnesses may be summoned and sworn on the trial of an election petition to which section 229(3) applies in the same manner, as nearly as circumstances admit, as in the trial of an ordinary action."
14584,1852,New Zealand,"2. The High Court may by order require any person who appears to the court to have been concerned in the election to attend as a witness, and every person who refuses to obey any such order shall be guilty of contempt of court."
14585,1852,New Zealand,"3. The court may examine any person so required to attend or any person in court, although he or she is not called or examined by any party to the petition."
14586,1852,New Zealand,"4. After the examination of a witness as aforesaid by the court, he or she may be cross-examined by or on behalf of the petitioner and respondent, or either of them."

14588,1852,New Zealand,"1. A person called as a witness on the trial of an election petition to which section 229(3) applies shall not be excused from answering any question relating to any offence at or connected with the election on the ground that the answer thereto may incriminate or tend to incriminate himself or herself, or on the ground of privilege: provided that—"
14589,1852,New Zealand,"a.an answer by a person to a question put by or before the court shall not, except in the case of any criminal proceeding for perjury in respect of the evidence, be admissible in evidence against that person in any proceeding, civil or criminal:"
14590,1852,New Zealand,"b.a witness who answers truly all questions which he or she is required by the court to answer shall be entitled to receive a certificate of indemnity, stating that he or she has so answered."
14591,1852,New Zealand,"2. Where a person has received a certificate of indemnity in relation to an election, and any legal proceeding is at any time instituted against that person for any offence committed by that person at or in connection with the election previously to the date of the certificate, the court having cognisance of the case shall on production of the certificate stay the proceeding, and may in its discretion award to the said person such costs as he or she has been put to in the proceeding."
14592,1852,New Zealand,3. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to relieve a person receiving a certificate of indemnity from any incapacity under this Act or from any proceedings to enforce any such incapacity (other than a criminal prosecution).
14593,1852,New Zealand,249. EXPENSES OF WITNESSES
14594,1852,New Zealand,"1. The reasonable expenses incurred by any person in appearing to give evidence at the trial of an election petition to which section 229(3) applies, according to the scale allowed to witnesses on the trial of civil actions, may be allowed to him or her by the court."
14595,1852,New Zealand,"2. Any such expenses, if the witness was called and examined by the court, shall be deemed to be part of the expenses of the court, and in other cases shall be deemed to be costs of the petition."
14596,1852,New Zealand,SUBPART 6. COSTS
14597,1852,New Zealand,250. COSTS OF PETITION
14598,1852,New Zealand,"1.

14599,1852,New Zealand,"2. If a petitioner fails for 6 months after demand to pay to any person summoned as a witness on the petitioner’s behalf, or to the respondent, any sum certified to be due to that person for costs, and the failure is within 1 year after the demand proved to the satisfaction of the High Court, every person who has under this Act entered into a recognisance relating to the petition shall be held to have made default in the recognisance, and it shall be dealt with in the manner provided by section 21 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1950."

15827,1852,New Zealand,"1. This section applies if the Commission receives, under section 76(2)(a), a complaint alleging that there has been a breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or both Parts."
15828,1852,New Zealand,"2. If the complaint or part of it concerns an enactment, or an act or omission that is authorised or required by an enactment, the complaint or relevant part of it must be treated only as a complaint that the enactment is in breach of Part 1A."
15829,1852,New Zealand,"3. Despite every other provision of this section, if the complaint or part of it concerns a judgment or other order of a court, or an act or omission of a court affecting the conduct of any proceedings, the Commission must take no further action in relation to the complaint or relevant part of it."
15830,1852,New Zealand,"4. If the complaint or part of it concerns an act or omission by a person or body referred to in section 3 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, and neither subsection (2) nor subsection (3) applies, the complaint or relevant part of it—"

15835,1852,New Zealand,"5. If the complaint or relevant part of it concerns a breach of Part 2, and none of subsections (2) to (4) applies to the complaint or relevant part of it, the complaint or relevant part of it must be treated only as a complaint that there has been a breach of the relevant provision or provisions of Part 2."
15836,1852,New Zealand,6. Nothing in this section prevents the Commission from involving any person that it considers appropriate in information gathering and the resolution of disputes.
15837,1852,New Zealand,79A. CHOICE OF PROCEDURES
15838,1852,New Zealand,"1. If the circumstances giving rise to a complaint under Part 2 are such that an employee would also be entitled to pursue a personal grievance under the Employment Relations Act 2000, the employee may take one, but not both, of the following steps:"
15839,1852,New Zealand,a.the employee may make in relation to those circumstances a complaint under this Act:
15840,1852,New Zealand,"b.the employee may, if the grievance is not otherwise resolved, apply to the Employment Relations Authority for the resolution of the grievance under the Employment Relations Act 2000."
15841,1852,New Zealand,"2. To avoid doubt, a complaint referred to in subsection (1) includes, but is not limited to, a complaint about sexual harassment or racial harassment."
15842,1852,New Zealand,"3. For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), an employee makes a complaint when proceedings about that complaint are commenced by the complainant or the Commission."
15843,1852,New Zealand,"4. If an employee makes a complaint under subsection (1)(a), the employee may not exercise or continue to exercise any rights relating to the subject matter of the complaint that the employee may have under the Employment Relations Act 2000."
15844,1852,New Zealand,"5. If an employee applies to the Employment Relations Authority for a resolution of the grievance under subsection (1)(b), the employee may not exercise or continue to exercise any rights relating to the subject matter of the grievance that the employee may have under this Act."
15845,1852,New Zealand,80. TAKING ACTION OR FURTHER ACTION IN RELATION TO COMPLAINT
15846,1852,New Zealand,1. The Commission may only take action or further action under this Part in relation to a complaint if the complainant or person alleged to be aggrieved (if not the complainant) informs the Commission that he or she wishes to proceed with the complaint.
15847,1852,New Zealand,2. The Commission may decline to take action or further action under this Part in relation to a complaint if the complaint relates to a matter of which the complainant or the person alleged to be aggrieved (if not the complainant) has had knowledge for more than 12 months before the complaint is received by the Commission.
15848,1852,New Zealand,"3. The Commission may also decline to take action or further action under this Part in relation to a complaint if, in the Commission’s opinion,—"
15849,1852,New Zealand,a.the subject matter of the complaint is trivial; or
15850,1852,New Zealand,b.the complaint is frivolous or vexatious or is not made in good faith; or
15851,1852,New Zealand,"c.having regard to all the circumstances of the case, it is unnecessary to take further action in relation to the complaint; or"
15852,1852,New Zealand,"d.there is in all the circumstances an adequate remedy or right of appeal, other than the right to petition Parliament or to make a complaint to the Ombudsman, that it would be reasonable for the complainant or the person alleged to be aggrieved (if not the complainant) to exercise."
15853,1852,New Zealand,"4. If the Commission decides to take no action or no further action in relation to a complaint, it must inform the complainant or the person alleged to be aggrieved (if not the complainant) and the person against whom the complaint is made—"
15854,1852,New Zealand,a.of that decision; and
15855,1852,New Zealand,b.of the reasons for that decision; and
15856,1852,New Zealand,"c.of his or her right, under section 92B, to bring proceedings before the Human Rights Review Tribunal."
15857,1852,New Zealand,81. COMMISSION TO INFORM PARTIES OF PROCESS
15858,1852,New Zealand,"1. Before gathering information about a complaint, the Commission must comply with subsections (2) and (4)."
15859,1852,New Zealand,"2. The Commission must inform the following persons of the Commission’s intention to gather information under section 82, and provide them with general information about the matters stated in subsection (3):"

15861,1852,New Zealand,b.any person alleged to be aggrieved (if not the complainant); and
15862,1852,New Zealand,c.the person against whom the complaint is made; and
15863,1852,New Zealand,"d.if the complaint alleges a breach of Part 1A, or alleges a breach of Part 2 by a person or body referred to in section 3 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, the Attorney-General:"
15864,1852,New Zealand,e.any other person or body that the Commission considers relevant.

15870,1852,New Zealand,a.of the details of the complaint (if any); and
15871,1852,New Zealand,"b.of the right of that person and, if subsection (2)(d) applies, of the Attorney-General to submit to the Commission, within a reasonable time, information in response to the complaint."

15881,1852,New Zealand,2. The Commission must use its best endeavours to assist the parties to secure a settlement.
15882,1852,New Zealand,"3. In this section, settlement—"

A person against whom a complaint referred to in section 76(2)(a) has been made may bring civil proceedings before the Tribunal in relation to the complaint if no proceedings in relation to the complaint have been brought under subsection (1) by, or on behalf of, the complainant or person aggrieved or a class of persons."
15969,1852,New Zealand,"4. If parties to a complaint under section 76(2)(a) have reached a settlement of the complaint (whether through mediation or otherwise) but one of them is failing to observe a term of the settlement, another of them may bring proceedings before the Tribunal to enforce the settlement."
15970,1852,New Zealand,"5. The rights given by subsections (1), (3), and (4) are not limited or affected just because the Commission or a mediator at a dispute resolution meeting or the Director is taking any action in relation to the complaint concerned."
15971,1852,New Zealand,"6. Despite subsection (2), the Commission may bring proceedings under subsection (1) only if—"
15972,1852,New Zealand,a.the complainant or person aggrieved (if not the complainant) has not brought proceedings; and
15973,1852,New Zealand,b.the Commission has obtained the agreement of that person before bringing the proceedings; and
15974,1852,New Zealand,c.it considers that bringing the proceedings will facilitate the performance of its functions stated in section 5(2)(a).
15975,1852,New Zealand,"7. Despite subsections (1) to (6), no proceedings may be brought under this section in respect of a complaint or relevant part of a complaint to which section 79(3) applies."
15976,1852,New Zealand,92BA. LODGING OF APPLICATIONS

15979,1852,New Zealand,1. A party to proceedings before the Tribunal or related proceedings may appear and be heard—
15980,1852,New Zealand,"a.in person, or by a barrister or solicitor provided by the person; or"
15981,1852,New Zealand,"b.by a barrister or solicitor provided by the Director if, and to the extent that, the Director has decided, under section 90(1)(a) or (c) or (2), to provide representation for the party in the proceedings."
15982,1852,New Zealand,"2. The Tribunal may, on an application for the purpose by any person, give directions as to the representation, in proceedings before it, of a plaintiff of a kind referred to in section 92N(1) to (3) or of any other party to the proceedings who may be able to bring, take part in, or defend the proceedings, only through a representative."
15983,1852,New Zealand,3. The Office of Human Rights Proceedings must pay all costs of representation provided—
15984,1852,New Zealand,"a.by the Director for a complainant, aggrieved person, group of persons, or party to a settlement of a complaint; and"
15985,1852,New Zealand,b.in accordance with a decision of the Director under section 90(1)(a) or (c).
15986,1852,New Zealand,4. The Office of Human Rights Proceedings must pay any award of costs made against a person in proceedings for which representation is provided for that person by the Director.
15987,1852,New Zealand,5. Any award of costs made in favour of a person in proceedings for which representation is provided for that person by the Director must be paid to the Office of Human Rights Proceedings.
15988,1852,New Zealand,"6. Nothing in this Act limits or affects the entitlement to legal aid (if any) of a party in respect of proceedings or intended proceedings (whether or not representation for the party in the proceedings may, or is to be, is being, or has been, provided in accordance with a decision of the Director under section 90(1)(a) or (c))."
15989,1852,New Zealand,"92D. TRIBUNAL MAY REFER COMPLAINT BACK TO COMMISSION, OR ADJOURN PROCEEDINGS TO SEEK RESOLUTION BY SETTLEMENT"
15990,1852,New Zealand,"1. When proceedings under section 92B are brought, the Tribunal—"
15991,1852,New Zealand,a.must (whether through a member or officer) first consider whether an attempt has been made to resolve the complaint (whether through mediation or otherwise); and
15992,1852,New Zealand,"b.must refer the complaint under section 76(2)(a) to which the proceedings relate back to the Commission unless the Tribunal is satisfied that attempts at resolution, or further attempts at resolution, of the complaint by the parties and the Commission—"
15993,1852,New Zealand,i.will not contribute constructively to resolving the complaint; or
15994,1852,New Zealand,"ii.will not, in the circumstances, be in the public interest; or"
15995,1852,New Zealand,iii.will undermine the urgent or interim nature of the proceedings.
15996,1852,New Zealand,"2. The Tribunal may, at any time before, during, or after the hearing of proceedings, refer a complaint under section 76(2)(a) back to the Commission if it appears to the Tribunal, from what is known to it about the complaint, that the complaint may yet be able to be resolved by the parties and the Commission (for example, by mediation)."
15997,1852,New Zealand,"3. The Tribunal may, instead of exercising the power conferred by subsection (2), adjourn any proceedings relating to a complaint under section 76(2)(a) for a specified period if it appears to the Tribunal, from what is known about the complaint, that the complaint may yet be able to be resolved by the parties."
15998,1852,New Zealand,92E. CIVIL PROCEEDINGS ARISING FROM INQUIRY BY COMMISSION
15999,1852,New Zealand,"1. If the Commission considers that an inquiry by it under section 5(2)(h) has disclosed or may have disclosed a breach of a kind referred to in any of paragraphs (a) to (c), it may bring civil proceedings before the Tribunal,—"
16000,1852,New Zealand,"a.for a breach of Part 1A (other than a breach of Part 1A that is an enactment, or an act or omission authorised or required by an enactment or otherwise by law), against the person or persons alleged to be responsible for the breach:"
16001,1852,New Zealand,"b.for a breach of Part 1A that is an enactment, or an act or omission authorised or required by an enactment or otherwise by law, against the Attorney-General, or against a person or body referred to in section 3(b) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 alleged to be responsible for the breach:"
16002,1852,New Zealand,"c.for a breach of Part 2, against the person or persons alleged to be responsible for the breach."
16003,1852,New Zealand,2. The Commission may exercise the right in subsection (1) only if it considers that the exercise of the right will facilitate the performance of its functions stated in section 5(2)(a).
16004,1852,New Zealand,3. This section does not limit section 6 or section 92H or section 97.
16005,1852,New Zealand,92F. PROOF OF JUSTIFIED LIMITS AND EXCEPTIONS
16006,1852,New Zealand,"1. The onus of proving, in any proceedings under this Part, that an act or omission is, under section 5 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, a justified limit on the right to freedom from discrimination affirmed by section 19 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 lies on the defendant."
16007,1852,New Zealand,"2. The onus of proving, in any proceedings under this Part, that conduct is, under any provision of Part 2, excepted from conduct that is unlawful under any provision of Part 2 lies on the defendant."
16008,1852,New Zealand,92G. RIGHT OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL TO APPEAR IN CIVIL PROCEEDINGS
16009,1852,New Zealand,"1. The Attorney-General may appear and be heard, in person or by a barrister or solicitor,—"
16010,1852,New Zealand,"a.in proceedings before the Human Rights Review Tribunal alleging a breach of Part 1A, or alleging a breach of Part 2 by a person or body referred to in section 3 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990:"
16011,1852,New Zealand,b.in proceedings in any of the following courts in relation to proceedings of a kind referred to in paragraph (a) that are or have been before the Human Rights Review Tribunal:

16015,1852,New Zealand,iv.the Supreme Court.
16016,1852,New Zealand,2. The right to appear and be heard given by subsection (1) may be exercised whether or not the Attorney-General is or was a party to the proceedings before the Human Rights Review Tribunal.
16017,1852,New Zealand,"3. If, under subsection (1), the Attorney-General appears in any proceedings of a kind described in that subsection, he or she has, unless those proceedings are by way of appeal, the right to adduce evidence and the right to cross-examine witnesses."
16018,1852,New Zealand,92H. RIGHT OF COMMISSION TO APPEAR IN CIVIL PROCEEDINGS
16019,1852,New Zealand,"1. The Commission may appear and be heard, in person or by a barrister or solicitor,—"
16020,1852,New Zealand,a.in proceedings before the Human Rights Review Tribunal; and
16021,1852,New Zealand,b.in proceedings in any of the following courts in relation to proceedings that are or have been before the Human Rights Review Tribunal:

16025,1852,New Zealand,iv.the Supreme Court.
16026,1852,New Zealand,2. The right to appear and be heard given by subsection (1) may be exercised—
16027,1852,New Zealand,a.whether or not the Commission is or was a party to the proceedings before the Human Rights Review Tribunal; but
16028,1852,New Zealand,b.only if the Commission considers that the exercise of the right will facilitate the performance of its functions stated in section 5(2)(a).
16029,1852,New Zealand,"3. If, under subsection (1), the Commission appears in any proceedings of a kind described in that subsection, it has, unless those proceedings are by way of appeal, the right to adduce evidence and the right to cross-examine witnesses."
16030,1852,New Zealand,4. This section is not limited by section 92B or section 92E or section 97.
16031,1852,New Zealand,SUBPART 2. REMEDIES
16032,1852,New Zealand,92I. REMEDIES
16033,1852,New Zealand,1. This section is subject to sections 92J and 92K (which relate to the only remedy that may be granted by the Tribunal if it finds that an enactment is in breach of Part 1A).
16034,1852,New Zealand,"2. In proceedings before the Human Rights Review Tribunal brought under section 92B(1) or (4) or section 92E, the plaintiff may seek any of the remedies described in subsection (3) that the plaintiff thinks fit."
16035,1852,New Zealand,"3. If, in proceedings referred to in subsection (2), the Tribunal is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the defendant has committed a breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint, the Tribunal may grant 1 or more of the following remedies:"
16036,1852,New Zealand,a.a declaration that the defendant has committed a breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint:
16037,1852,New Zealand,"b.an order restraining the defendant from continuing or repeating the breach, or from engaging in, or causing or permitting others to engage in, conduct of the same kind as that constituting the breach, or conduct of any similar kind specified in the order:"
16038,1852,New Zealand,c.damages in accordance with sections 92M to 92O:
16039,1852,New Zealand,"d.an order that the defendant perform any acts specified in the order with a view to redressing any loss or damage suffered by the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person as a result of the breach:"
16040,1852,New Zealand,e.a declaration that any contract entered into or performed in contravention of any provision of Part 1A or Part 2 is an illegal contract:
16041,1852,New Zealand,"f.an order that the defendant undertake any specified training or any other programme, or implement any specified policy or programme, in order to assist or enable the defendant to comply with the provisions of this Act:"
16042,1852,New Zealand,"g.relief in accordance with the Illegal Contracts Act 1970 in respect of any such contract to which the defendant and the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person are parties:"
16043,1852,New Zealand,h.any other relief the Tribunal thinks fit.
16044,1852,New Zealand,"4. It is no defence to proceedings referred to in subsection (2) or subsection (5) that the breach was unintentional or without negligence on the part of the party against whom the complaint was made, but, subject to section 92P, the Tribunal must take the conduct of the parties into account in deciding what, if any, remedy to grant."
16045,1852,New Zealand,"5. In proceedings before the Human Rights Review Tribunal brought, under section 92B(3), by the person against whom a complaint was made, that person may seek a declaration that he or she has not committed a breach of Part 1A or Part 2."
16046,1852,New Zealand,92J. REMEDY FOR ENACTMENTS IN BREACH OF PART 1A
16047,1852,New Zealand,"1. If, in proceedings before the Human Rights Review Tribunal, the Tribunal finds that an enactment is in breach of Part 1A, the only remedy that the Tribunal may grant is the declaration referred to in subsection (2)."
16048,1852,New Zealand,"2. The declaration that may be granted by the Tribunal, if subsection (1) applies, is a declaration that the enactment that is the subject of the finding is inconsistent with the right to freedom from discrimination affirmed by section 19 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990."
16049,1852,New Zealand,3. The Tribunal may not grant a declaration under subsection (2) unless that decision has the support of all or a majority of the members of the Tribunal.
16050,1852,New Zealand,4. Nothing in this section affects the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.
16051,1852,New Zealand,92K. EFFECT OF DECLARATION
16052,1852,New Zealand,1. A declaration under section 92J does not—
16053,1852,New Zealand,"a.affect the validity, application, or enforcement of the enactment in respect of which it is given; or"
16054,1852,New Zealand,"b.prevent the continuation of the act, omission, policy, or activity that was the subject of the complaint."
16055,1852,New Zealand,"2. If a declaration is made under section 92J and that declaration is not overturned on appeal or the time for lodging an appeal expires, the Minister for the time being responsible for the administration of the enactment must present to the House of Representatives—"
16056,1852,New Zealand,a.a report bringing the declaration to the attention of the House of Representatives; and
16057,1852,New Zealand,b.a report containing advice on the Government’s response to the declaration.
16058,1852,New Zealand,"3. The Minister referred to in subsection (2) must carry out the duties imposed on the Minister by that subsection within 120 days of the date of disposal of all appeals against the granting of the declaration or, if no appeal is lodged, the date when the time for lodging an appeal expires."
16059,1852,New Zealand,92L. COSTS
16060,1852,New Zealand,"1. In any proceedings under section 92B or section 92E or section 97, the Tribunal may make any award as to costs that it thinks fit, whether or not it grants any other remedy."
16061,1852,New Zealand,"2. Without limiting the matters that the Tribunal may consider in determining whether to make an award of costs under this section, the Tribunal may take into account whether, and to what extent, any party to the proceedings—"
16062,1852,New Zealand,a.has participated in good faith in the process of information gathering by the Commission:
16063,1852,New Zealand,b.has facilitated or obstructed that information-gathering process:
16064,1852,New Zealand,c.has acted in a manner that facilitated the resolution of the issues that were the subject of the proceedings.
16065,1852,New Zealand,92M. DAMAGES
16066,1852,New Zealand,"1. In any proceedings under section 92B(1) or (4) or section 92E, the Tribunal may award damages against the defendant for a breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint in respect of any 1 or more of the following:"
16067,1852,New Zealand,"a.pecuniary loss suffered as a result of, and expenses reasonably incurred by the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person for the purpose of, the transaction or activity out of which the breach arose:"
16068,1852,New Zealand,"b.loss of any benefit, whether or not of a monetary kind, that the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person might reasonably have been expected to obtain but for the breach:"
16069,1852,New Zealand,"c.humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to the feelings of the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person."
16070,1852,New Zealand,"2. This section applies subject to sections 92J, 92N, and 92O and to subpart 1 of Part 2 of the Prisoners’ and Victims’ Claims Act 2005."
16071,1852,New Zealand,92N. DIRECTIONS AS TO PAYMENT OF DAMAGES IN CERTAIN CASES
16072,1852,New Zealand,"1. If the plaintiff is a minor who is not married or in a civil union, the Tribunal may, in its discretion, direct the defendant to pay damages awarded under section 92M to Public Trust or to a person or trustee corporation acting as the manager of any property of the plaintiff."
16073,1852,New Zealand,"2. If the plaintiff is a mentally disordered person within the meaning of section 2(1) of the Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 1992 whose property is not being managed under the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988, but who lacks, in the opinion of the Tribunal, the mental capacity to manage his or her own affairs in relation to his or her own property, the Tribunal may, in its discretion, direct the defendant to pay damages awarded under section 92M to Public Trust."
16074,1852,New Zealand,"3. If the plaintiff is a person whose property is being managed under the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988, the Tribunal must ascertain whether the terms of the property order cover management of money received as damages and,—"
16075,1852,New Zealand,"a.if damages fall within the terms of the property order, the Tribunal must direct the defendant to pay damages awarded under section 92M to the person or trustee corporation acting as the property manager; or"
16076,1852,New Zealand,"b.if damages do not fall within the terms of the property order, the Tribunal may, in its discretion, direct the defendant to pay damages awarded under section 92M to Public Trust."
16077,1852,New Zealand,"4. If money is paid to Public Trust under any of subsections (1) to (3),—"
16078,1852,New Zealand,a.section 12 of the Minors’ Contracts Act 1969 applies in the case of a minor who is not married or in a civil union; and
16079,1852,New Zealand,"b.sections 108D, 108F, and 108G of the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988 apply, with any necessary modifications, in the case of a person referred to in subsection (2) or subsection (3)(b); and"
16080,1852,New Zealand,"c.section 108E of the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988 applies, with any necessary modifications, in the case of a person referred to in subsection (3)(a)."
16081,1852,New Zealand,92O. TRIBUNAL MAY DEFER OR MODIFY REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF PART 1A OR PART 2 OR TERMS OF SETTLEMENT
16082,1852,New Zealand,"1. If, in any proceedings under this Part, the Tribunal determines that an act or omission is in breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint, it may, on the application of any party to the proceedings, take 1 or more of the actions stated in subsection (2)."
16083,1852,New Zealand,"2. The actions are,—"
16084,1852,New Zealand,"a.instead of, or as well as, awarding damages or granting any other remedy,—"
16085,1852,New Zealand,i.to specify a period during which the defendant must remedy the breach; and
16086,1852,New Zealand,ii.to adjourn the proceedings to a specified date to enable further consideration of the remedies or further remedies (if any) to be granted:
16087,1852,New Zealand,b.to refuse to grant any remedy that has retrospective effect:
16088,1852,New Zealand,c.to refuse to grant any remedy in respect of an act or omission that occurred before the bringing of proceedings or the date of the determination of the Tribunal or any other date specified by the Tribunal:
16089,1852,New Zealand,d.to provide that any remedy granted has effect only prospectively or only from a date specified by the Tribunal:
16090,1852,New Zealand,e.to provide that the retrospective effect of any remedy is limited in a way specified by the Tribunal.
16091,1852,New Zealand,92P. MATTERS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN EXERCISING POWERS GIVEN BY SECTION 92O
16092,1852,New Zealand,"1. In determining whether to take 1 or more of the actions referred to in section 92O, the Tribunal must take account of the following matters:"
16093,1852,New Zealand,a.whether or not the defendant in the proceedings has acted in good faith:
16094,1852,New Zealand,"b.whether or not the interests of any person or body not represented in the proceedings would be adversely affected if 1 or more of the actions referred to in section 92O is, or is not, taken:"
16095,1852,New Zealand,c.whether or not the proceedings involve a significant issue that has not previously been considered by the Tribunal:
16096,1852,New Zealand,d.the social and financial implications of granting any remedy sought by the plaintiff:
16097,1852,New Zealand,e.the significance of the loss or harm suffered by any person as a result of the breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint:
16098,1852,New Zealand,f.the public interest generally:
16099,1852,New Zealand,g.any other matter that the Tribunal considers relevant.
16100,1852,New Zealand,"2. If the Tribunal finds that an act or omission is in breach of Part 1A or that an act or omission by a person or body referred to in section 3 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 is in breach of Part 2, in determining whether to take 1 or more of the actions referred to in section 92O, the Tribunal must, in addition to the matters specified in subsection (1), take account of—"
16101,1852,New Zealand,a.the requirements of fair public administration; and
16102,1852,New Zealand,b.the obligation of the Government to balance competing demands for the expenditure of public money.
16103,1852,New Zealand,SUBPART 3. MONETARY LIMITS ON REMEDIES TRIBUNAL MAY GRANT
16104,1852,New Zealand,92Q. MONETARY LIMITS ON REMEDIES TRIBUNAL MAY GRANT
16105,1852,New Zealand,1. Proceedings under section 92B or section 92E may be brought before the Human Rights Review Tribunal irrespective of the amount of damages claimed or the value of the property in respect of which any remedy is sought.
16106,1852,New Zealand,"2. However, except as provided in sections 92R to 92V, the Tribunal must not award any damages or grant any remedy in any proceedings of that kind if the making of that award or the granting of that remedy would, because of the monetary limits contained in sections 29 to 34 of the District Courts Act 1947, be beyond the jurisdiction of a District Court."
16107,1852,New Zealand,"3. For the purposes of subsection (2), if civil proceedings under section 92B are brought on behalf of more than 1 complainant or, as the case may be, more than 1 aggrieved person, those proceedings must, for the purpose of applying any monetary limit under subsection (2), be treated as if each complainant or, as the case may be, each aggrieved person on whose behalf those proceedings are brought, were the plaintiff in a separate action against the defendant."
16108,1852,New Zealand,SUBPART 4. GRANTING OF REMEDIES BY HIGH COURT ON REFERENCE FROM TRIBUNAL
16109,1852,New Zealand,92R. TRIBUNAL TO REFER GRANTING OF REMEDIES TO HIGH COURT
16110,1852,New Zealand,"The Human Rights Review Tribunal must refer the granting of a remedy in any proceedings under section 92B or section 92E to the High Court if the Tribunal is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that a defendant in the proceedings has committed a breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint, but that—"
16111,1852,New Zealand,a.the granting of the appropriate remedy under section 92I would be outside the limits imposed by section 92Q; or
16112,1852,New Zealand,b.that the granting of a remedy in those proceedings would be better dealt with by the High Court.
16113,1852,New Zealand,92S. FURTHER PROVISIONS ON REFERENCE TO HIGH COURT
16114,1852,New Zealand,"1. A reference under section 92R is made by sending, to the Registrar of the High Court nearest to where the proceedings were commenced, a report on the proceedings that—"
16115,1852,New Zealand,a.sets out the Tribunal’s finding with regard to the breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint; and
16116,1852,New Zealand,"b.includes, or is accompanied by, a statement of the considerations to which the Tribunal has had regard in making the reference to that court."
16117,1852,New Zealand,2. A copy of the report must be given or sent promptly to every party to the proceedings.
16118,1852,New Zealand,"3. Except as provided in this Act, the procedure for a reference under section 92R is the same as the procedure prescribed by rules of court in respect of appeals, and those rules apply with all necessary modifications."
16119,1852,New Zealand,92T. HIGH COURT DECIDES REMEDIES ON REFERENCE FROM TRIBUNAL
16120,1852,New Zealand,1. This section applies where the granting of a remedy in any proceedings under section 92B or section 92E is referred to the High Court under section 92R.
16121,1852,New Zealand,2. The High Court may direct the Tribunal to amplify any report made under section 92S(1).
16122,1852,New Zealand,"3. Every person who, under section 92S(2), is given or sent a copy of a report under section 92S(1) is entitled to be heard and to tender in the High Court evidence as to the remedy (if any) to be granted on the basis of the Tribunal’s finding that the defendant has committed a breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint."
16123,1852,New Zealand,"4. However, no person referred to in subsection (3) may, on the reference under section 92R, challenge the finding of the Tribunal referred to in subsection (3)."
16124,1852,New Zealand,"5. The High Court must decide, on the basis of the Tribunal’s finding that the defendant has committed a breach of Part 1A or Part 2, whether 1 or more of the remedies set out in section 92I or the remedy set out in section 92J is to be granted."
16125,1852,New Zealand,"92U. HIGH COURT’S DECISION ON REMEDIES TO BE INCLUDED IN, AND GIVEN EFFECT TO AS PART OF, TRIBUNAL’S DETERMINATION"
16126,1852,New Zealand,1. Every decision of the High Court under section 92T(5)—
16127,1852,New Zealand,a.must be remitted to the Tribunal for inclusion in its determination with regard to the proceedings; and
16128,1852,New Zealand,b.has effect as part of that determination despite the limits imposed by section 92Q.
16129,1852,New Zealand,2. Nothing in subsection (1)—
16130,1852,New Zealand,a.limits sections 123 to 125; or

16133,1852,New Zealand,92V. ABANDONMENT TO ENABLE TRIBUNAL TO MAKE AWARD OF DAMAGES
16134,1852,New Zealand,1. This section applies where the Tribunal would have jurisdiction in any proceedings under section 92B or section 92E to make an award of damages in accordance with section 92M if the amount of the award were within the limit for the time being fixed by section 29(1) of the District Courts Act 1947 (as applied by section 92Q(2)).
16135,1852,New Zealand,2. The Tribunal may make an award within that limit if the plaintiff abandons the excess.
16136,1852,New Zealand,3. An award of damages in those proceedings in accordance with section 92M operates to discharge from liability in respect of the amount abandoned in that way any person against whom the proceedings are brought and the subsequent award is made.
16137,1852,New Zealand,4. This section overrides sections 92Q to 92U.
16138,1852,New Zealand,92W. EXTENSION OF JURISDICTION BY AGREEMENT BETWEEN PARTIES
16139,1852,New Zealand,"1. If, in any proceedings under section 92B or section 92E, only section 92Q prevents the Tribunal from granting any 1 or more of the remedies stated in section 92I, and the parties to the proceedings, by memorandum signed by them or their respective solicitors or agents, agree that the Tribunal is to have jurisdiction to grant any 1 or more of those remedies irrespective of section 92Q, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to grant 1 or more of those remedies accordingly."

16326,1852,New Zealand,"1A. If, in any proceedings before the Tribunal, the validity of any regulation is questioned, the Tribunal must, unless it considers that there is no arguable case in support of the contention that the regulation is invalid, either—"
16327,1852,New Zealand,a.state a case for the opinion of the High Court on the relevant question or questions of law; or

16332,1852,New Zealand,"5. The High Court shall hear and determine any question submitted to it under this section, and shall remit the case with its opinion to the Tribunal."
16333,1852,New Zealand,122A. REMOVAL TO HIGH COURT OF PROCEEDINGS OR ISSUE

16335,1852,New Zealand,"2. The Tribunal may make an order under this section, with the leave of the High Court, before or during the hearing, and either on the application of a party to the proceedings or on its own initiative, but only if—"
16336,1852,New Zealand,a.an important question of law is likely to arise in the proceedings or matter other than incidentally; or
16337,1852,New Zealand,"b.the validity of any regulation is questioned in proceedings before the Tribunal (whether on the ground that it authorises or requires unjustifiable discrimination in circumstances where the statutory provision purportedly empowering the making of the regulation does not authorise the making of a regulation authorising or requiring unjustified discrimination, or otherwise); or"
16338,1852,New Zealand,c.the nature and the urgency of the proceedings or matter mean that it is in the public interest that they or it be removed immediately to the High Court; or
16339,1852,New Zealand,"d.the High Court already has before it other proceedings, or other matters, that are between the same parties and involve issues that are the same as, or similar or related to, those raised by the proceedings or matter; or"

16342,1852,New Zealand,"4. If the Tribunal declines to remove proceedings, or a matter at issue in them, to the High Court (whether as a result of the refusal of the High Court to grant leave or otherwise), the party applying for the removal may seek the special leave of the High Court for an order of the High Court that the proceedings or matter be removed to the High Court and, in determining whether to grant an order of that kind, the High Court must apply the criteria stated in subsection (2)(a) to (d)."
16343,1852,New Zealand,"5. An order for removal to the High Court under this section may be made subject to any conditions the Tribunal or the High Court, as the case may be, thinks fit."

16347,1852,New Zealand,"2. If the Tribunal, under section 122A, orders that proceedings, or a matter at issue in them, be removed to the High Court, and the High Court makes no order under subsection (1),—"
16348,1852,New Zealand,"a.the High Court must determine the proceedings or matter and may exercise any power that the Tribunal could have exercised in, or in relation to, the proceedings or matter; and"
16349,1852,New Zealand,"b.a party to the proceedings may, under section 124, appeal to the Court of Appeal against the determination of the High Court on a question of law arising in the proceedings."

16360,1852,New Zealand,b.the Tribunal does not grant the remedy in relation to that enactment.
16361,1852,New Zealand,"3. Where any party is dissatisfied with any decision of the Tribunal making a declaration under section 97, that party may appeal to the High Court against the whole or any part of that decision."

16365,1852,New Zealand,"a.confirm, modify, or reverse the order or decision appealed against, or any part of that order or decision:"
16366,1852,New Zealand,b.exercise any of the powers that could have been exercised by the Tribunal in the proceedings to which the appeal relates.
16367,1852,New Zealand,"7. Notwithstanding anything in subsection (6), the court may in any case, instead of determining any appeal, refer to the Tribunal, in accordance with the rules of court, for further consideration by the Tribunal, the whole or any part of the matter to which the appeal relates."
16368,1852,New Zealand,"8. Subject to the provisions of this Act, the procedure in respect of any such appeal shall be in accordance with the rules of court."
16369,1852,New Zealand,9. Notice of appeal shall not operate as a stay of proceedings in respect of the decision to which the appeal relates unless the Tribunal or the High Court so orders.

No action of the Judge, and no decision of the Court, may be questioned on the ground that the occasion for the Judge to perform the duty or exercise the power had not arisen or had ceased."

16850,1852,New Zealand,22. TERM OF OFFICE OF JUDGES
16851,1852,New Zealand,A Judge of the Supreme Court holds office until he or she ceases to hold office as a permanent Judge of the High Court.

16854,1852,New Zealand,2. Each acting Judge must be appointed for a stated term that—
16855,1852,New Zealand,a.is not more than the time until the Judge will reach the age of 75 years:
16856,1852,New Zealand,"b.in any case, is not more than 24 months."
16857,1852,New Zealand,"3. During the term of his or her appointment, an acting Judge may act as a Judge of the Supreme Court to the extent only that the Chief Justice authorises under subsection (4)."
16858,1852,New Zealand,4. The Chief Justice may authorise an acting Judge to act as a member of the Supreme Court—
16859,1852,New Zealand,a.to hear and determine any proceedings within a stated period; or
16860,1852,New Zealand,b.to hear and determine stated proceedings.
16861,1852,New Zealand,5. The Chief Justice may authorise an acting Judge to act as a member of the Supreme Court only if satisfied that—
16862,1852,New Zealand,a.there is a vacancy in the Supreme Court; or
16863,1852,New Zealand,b.a Judge of the Supreme Court is for any reason unavailable to hear proceedings or particular proceedings.
16864,1852,New Zealand,"6. An acting Judge is authorised when the Chief Justice gives the Attorney-General a certificate, signed by the Chief Justice and at least 2 other permanent Judges of the Supreme Court, to the effect that in their opinion it is necessary for the proper conduct of the Court’s business for the acting Judge to be authorised to act as a member of the Supreme Court—"
16865,1852,New Zealand,a.to hear and determine proceedings within the period concerned; or
16866,1852,New Zealand,b.to hear and determine the proceedings concerned.
16867,1852,New Zealand,"7. An acting Judge has the jurisdiction, powers, protections, privileges, and immunities of a Judge of the Supreme Court and the High Court, but only in relation to acting as a member of the Supreme Court, under the authority of subsection (4), in the hearing and determination of a proceeding."
16868,1852,New Zealand,"8. While acting as a member of the Supreme Court, under the authority of subsection (4), in the hearing and determination of a proceeding, but not otherwise, an acting Judge must be paid—"
16869,1852,New Zealand,a.a salary at the rate for the time being payable to a Judge of the Supreme Court other than the Chief Justice; and
16870,1852,New Zealand,"b.any applicable allowances, being travelling allowances or other incidental or minor allowances, determined by the Governor-General for acting Judges."
16871,1852,New Zealand,"9. The fact that an acting Judge acts as a member of the Supreme Court is conclusive proof of the Judge’s authority to do so. No action of the Judge, and no decision of the Court, may be questioned on the ground that the occasion for the Judge to act as a member of the Court had not arisen or had ceased."
16872,1852,New Zealand,10. An acting Judge may resign office by written notice to the Attorney-General.

16885,1852,New Zealand,2. Any 2 or more permanent Judges of the Supreme Court can act as the Court—
16886,1852,New Zealand,"a.to decide whether an oral hearing of an application for leave to appeal to the Court should be held, or the application should be determined just on the basis of written submissions:"
16887,1852,New Zealand,b.to determine an application for leave to appeal to the Court.

16899,1852,New Zealand,"3. The fact that a Judge of the Supreme Court other than the Chief Justice presides over the Court is conclusive proof of the Judge’s authority to do so. No action of the Judge, and no judgment or decision of the Court, may be questioned on the ground that the occasion for the Judge to preside over the Court had not arisen or had ceased."
16900,1852,New Zealand,30. PROCEDURE IF JUDGES ABSENT
16901,1852,New Zealand,"1. Where, because of the death or unavailability of 1 or 2 of the Judges of the Supreme Court who are about to begin or have begun hearing a proceeding, only 3 or 4 of those Judges remain available to determine it,—"
