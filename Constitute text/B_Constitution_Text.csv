Inspectoral authorities of the Federation can for this purpose be delegated to the municipality; in each and every case the Governor shall be informed hereof."

If a Land does not observe this deadline, competence for the issue of the implementing legislation passes from that Land to the Federation. As soon as the Land has issued the implementing legislation, the Federation becomes invalidated. If the Federation has not established any principles, Land legislation is free to settle such matters. As soon as the Federation has established principles, the provisions of Land legislation shall within the deadline to be appointed by Federal law be adjusted to the legislation as regards the principle law."

The conclusion of such agreements in the name of the Federation is, depending on the subject, incumbent on the Federal Government or the Federal Ministers. Agreements which are to be binding also on the authorities of the Federal legislature can be concluded by the Federal Government only with the approval of the National Council. Art 50 para 3 shall by analogy be applied to such resolutions of the National Council; they shall be published in the Federal Law Gazette."

202,1920,Austria,2. The Governor must inform the Federal Government before the initiation of negotiations about such a treaty. The Federal Government's approval must be obtained by the Governor before their conclusion. The approval is deemed to have been given if the Federal Government has not within eight weeks from the day that the request for approval has reached the Federal Chancellery told the Governor that approval is withheld. The authorization to initiate negotiations and to conclude the treaty is incumbent on the Federal President after the recommendation of the Land Government and with the countersignature of the Governor.

A measure taken by the Federation pursuant to this provision, in particular the issue of such a law or the issue of such an ordinance becomes invalid as soon as the Land has taken the requisite action."
205,1920,Austria,5. In the same way the Federation is in the case of implementation of state treaties entitled to supervision also in such matters as belong to the Laenders' own sphere of competence. The powers vested in the Federation as against the Laender are in this instance the same as in matters pertaining to indirect Federal administration (Art 102).

The Federal Government must present its recommendation with the consent of the Standing Sub-Committee to be appointed by the Main Committee of the National Council (Article 55, para 2). Such an ordinance requires the countersignature of the Federal Government."
213,1920,Austria,"4. Every ordinance issued in accordance with para 3 above shall without delay be submitted by the Federal Government to the National Council which if it is not in session at this time shall be convened by the Federal President, but if it is in session by the President of the National Council on one of the eight days following the submission. Within four weeks of the submission the National Council must either vote a corresponding Federal law in place of the ordinance or pass a resolution demanding that the ordinance immediately become invalidated. In the latter case the Federal Government must immediately meet this demand. In order that the resolution of the National Council may be adopted in time, the President shall at the latest submit the motion to the vote on the last day but one before expiry of the four weeks deadline; detailed provisions shall be made in the Federal law on the National Council's Standing Orders. If the ordinance is, in accordance with the previous provisions, rescinded by the Federal Government, the legal provisions which had been invalidated by the ordinance become effective again on the day of entry into force of the rescission."
214,1920,Austria,"5. The ordinances specified in para 3 above may not contain an amendment to provisions of Federal constitutional law and may have for their subject neither a permanent financial burden on the Federation nor a financial burden on the Laender or municipalities nor financial commitments for citizens nor an alienation of federal assets nor measures pertaining to matters specified in Art 10 para 1 subpara 11 nor, finally, such as concern the right of collective association or rent protection."

219,1920,Austria,"1. Under the direction of the highest authorities of the Federation and the Laender elected functionaries, appointed professional functionaries or contractually appointed functionaries conduct the administration in accordance with the provisions of the laws. They are responsible to their superiors for the exercise of their office and, save as provided otherwise by laws pursuant to para 2, bound by the instructions of these. The subordinate officer can refuse compliance with an instruction if the instruction was given by an authority not competent in the matter or compliance would infringe the criminal code."

229,1920,Austria,"be dispensed from being bound by instructions of their superior functionaries. Laender constitutional laws may create further categories of functionaries being dispensed from instructions. By law a right of supervision of the highest authorities adequate to the task of the functionaries being dispensed from instructions is to be provided, at least the right of information about all acts of the activity of the functionary being dispensed from instructions and - to the extent the organs are not subject to subpara 2, 5 and 8 - the right to remove functionaries dispensed from instruction from office."
230,1920,Austria,"3. All functionaries entrusted with Federal, Laender and municipal administrative duties as well as the functionaries of other public law corporate bodies are, save as otherwise provided by law, pledged to confidentiality about all facts of which they have obtained knowledge exclusively from their official activity and which have to be kept confidential in the interest of the maintenance of public peace, order and security, of comprehensive national defence, of external relations, in the interest of a public law corporate body, for the preparation of a ruling or in the preponderant interest of the parties involved (official confidentiality). Official secrecy does not exist for functionaries appointed by a popular representative body if it expressly asks for such information."
231,1920,Austria,"4. All functionaries entrusted with Federation, Laender and municipal administrative duties as well as the functionaries of other public law corporate bodies shall impart information about matters pertaining to their sphere of competence in so far as this does not conflict with a legal obligation to maintain confidentiality; an onus on professional associations to supply information extends only to members of their respective organizations and this inasmuch as fulfilment of their statutory functions is not impeded. The detailed regulations are, as regards the Federal authorities and the self-administration to be settled by Federal law in respect of legislation and execution, the business of the Federation; as regards the Laender and municipal authorities and the self-administration to be settled by Land law in respect of framework legislation, they are the business of the Federation while the implemental legislation and execution are Land business."
232,1920,Austria,ART 21
233,1920,Austria,"1. Legislation and execution in matters pertaining to the service code, including the regulations on service contracts, for and staff representation rights of employees of the Laender, the municipalities, and the municipal associations are, save as provided otherwise in the case of all these matters by para 2 below, by Art 14 para 2 and para 3 subpara d and para 5 subpara c and Art 14a para 2 subpara e and para 3 subpara b incumbent on the Laender.

235,1920,Austria,"3. Save as provided otherwise by this law, the service prerogative with regard to employees of the Federation is exercised by the highest authorities of the Federation. The service prerogative with regard to employees of the Laender is exercised by the highest authorities of the Laender; in so far as this law provides for appropriate exceptions with regard to employees of the Federation, it may be laid down by Land constitutional law that the service prerogative with regard to employees of the Land is exercised by equivalent authorities."
236,1920,Austria,"4. The possibility of an alternation of service between the Federation, the Laender, the municipalities, and the municipal associations remains guaranteed at all times to public employees. Legal provisions, according to which times of service are taken into account differently depending on whether they were served with the Federation, a Land, a municipality- or a municipal association, are inadmissible. In order to enable the service code, the staff representation regulations and the employee protection scheme of the Federation, the Laender, and the municipalities to develop along equal lines, the Federation and the Laender shall inform each other about their plans in these matters."

3244,2002,Bahrain,PREAMBLE
3245,2002,Bahrain,"In the name of God on high, and with His Blessing, and with His help, we Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, Sovereign of the Kingdom of Bahrain, in line with our determination, certainty, faith, and awareness of our national, pan-Arab and international Responsibilities; and in acknowledgment of our obligations to God, our obligations to the homeland and the citizens, and our commitment to fundamental principles and our responsibility to Mankind."
3246,2002,Bahrain,"And in implementation of the popular will expressed in the principles enshrined in the National Action Charter; pursuant to the authority entrusted to us by our great people to amend the Constitution; out of our desire to complete the requirements of the democratic system of government for our beloved nation; striving for a better future in which the homeland and the citizen will enjoy greater welfare, progress, development, stability and prosperity through earnest and constructive cooperation between government and citizens which will remove the obstacles to progress; and out of a conviction that the future and working for the future is what all of us seek in the coming state; and in view of our belief that such an objective requires the exertion of efforts; and in order to complete the march, we have amended the existing Constitution."
3247,2002,Bahrain,"This amendment has taken account of all the lofty values and the great human principles enshrined in the National Action Charter. These values and principles confirm that the people of Bahrain surge ahead in their triumphant march towards a bright future, God willing, a future in which the efforts of all parties and individuals unite, and the authorities in their new garb devote themselves to achieve the hopes and aspirations under his tolerant rule, declaring their adherence to Islam as a faith, a code of laws and a way of life, with their affiliation to the great Arab nation, and their association with the Gulf Cooperation Council now and in the future, and their striving for everything that will achieve justice, good and peace for the whole of Mankind."
3248,2002,Bahrain,"The amendments to the Constitution proceed from the premise that the noble people of Bahrain believe that Islam brings salvation in this world and the next, and that Islam means neither inertness nor fanaticism but explicitly states that wisdom is the goal of the believer wherever he finds it he should take it, and that the Qur’an has been remiss in nothing."
3249,2002,Bahrain,"In order to achieve this goal, it is essential that we listen and look to the whole of the human heritage in both East and West, adopting that which we consider to be beneficial and suitable and consistent with our religion, values and traditions and is appropriate to our circumstances, in the conviction that social and human systems are not inflexible tools and instruments which can be moved unchanged from place to place, but are messages conveyed to the mind, spirit and conscience of man and are influenced by his reactions and their circumstances of his society."
3250,2002,Bahrain,"Thus these constitutional amendments are representative of the advanced cultural thought of our beloved nation. They base our political system on a constitutional monarchy founded on counsel [shura], which in Islam is the highest model for governance, and on the people’s participation in the exercise of power, which is the foundation of modern political thought. The Ruler, with his perspicacity, chooses certain experienced people to constitute the Consultative Council (Majlis al-Shura), and the aware, free and loyal people choose through elections those who make up the Chamber of Deputies (Majlis al-Nuwwab), and thus the two chambers together achieve the popular will represented by the National Assembly (Al-Majlis al-Watani)."
3251,2002,Bahrain,"These constitutional amendments undoubtedly reflect the joint will of the King and the people, and achieve for everyone the lofty ideals and the great humanitarian principles contained in the National Action Charter, and ensure that the people will advance to the high position for which their ability and preparedness qualify them, and which accords with the greatness of their history, and allows them to occupy their appropriate place among the civilized nations of the world."
3252,2002,Bahrain,This Constitution that we have promulgated contains the amendments that have carried out in accordance with the provisions of the National Action Charter and that complement all the unamended texts.
3253,2002,Bahrain,We have attached an explanation memorandum which will be used to explain its judgment.

4669,1972,Bangladesh,"SCHEDULE 5. HISTORIC SPEECH OF THE FATHER OF THE NATION, BANGABANDHU SHEIKH MUJIBUR RAHMAN OF THE 7TH MARCH, 1971"
4670,1972,Bangladesh,"My brothers,"
4671,1972,Bangladesh,"I have come before you today with a heart laden with sadness. You are aware of everything and know all. We have tried with our lives. And yet the sadness remains that today, in Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi and Rangpur the streets are soaked in the blood of my brothers. Today the people of Bengal desire emancipation, the people of Bengal wish to live, the people of Bengal demand that their rights be acknowledged."
4672,1972,Bangladesh,"What wrong have we committed? Following the elections, the people of Bangladesh entrusted me and the Awami League with the totality of their electoral support. It was our expectation that the Parliament would meet, there we would frame our Constitution, that we would develop this land, that the people of this country would achieve their economic, political and cultural freedom. But it is a matter of grief that today we are constrained to say in all sadness that the history of the past twenty three years has been the history of a persecution of the people of Bengal, a history of the blood of the people of Bengal. This history of the past twenty three years has been one of the agonising cries of men and women."
4673,1972,Bangladesh,"The history of Bengal has been a history where the people of this land have made crimson the streets and highways of this land with their blood. We gave blood in 1952; in 1954, we won the elections and yet were not permitted to exercise power. In 1958, Ayub Khan imposed Martial Law and kept the nation in a state of slavery for ten long years. On 7 June 1966, as they rose in support of the Six-Point movement, the sons of my land were mown down in gunfire. When Yahya Khan took over once Ayub Khan fell in the fury of the movement of 1969, he promised that he would give us a Constitution, give us democracy. We put our faith on him. And then history moved a long way, the elections took place. I have met President Yahya Khan. I appealed to him, not just as the majority leader in Bengal but also as the majority leader in Pakistan, to convene the National Assembly on 15 February. He did not pay heed to my appeal. He paid heed to Mr. Bhutto. And he said that the assembly would be convened in the first week that we would discuss matters in the Assembly. I even went to the extent of suggesting that despite our being in a majority, if anyone proposes anything that is legitimate and right, we would accept his proposal."
4674,1972,Bangladesh,"Mr. Bhutto came here. He held negotiations with us, and when he left, he said that the door to talk had not closed, that more discussions would take place. After that, I spoke to other political leaders. I told them to join me in deliberations so that we could give shape to a Constitution for the country. But Mr. Bhutto said that if members elected from West Pakistan came here, the Assembly would turn into a slaughter house, an abattoir. He warned that anyone who went to the Assembly would end up losing his life. He issued dire warnings of closing down all the shop from Peshawar to Karachi if the Assembly Session went ahead. I said that the Assembly Session would go ahead. And then, suddenly, on the first of March the Assembly Session was put off. Mr. Yahya Khan, in exercise of his powers as president, had called the National Assembly into Session; and I had said that I would go to the Assembly. Mr. Bhutto said he would not go. Thirty five members came here from West Pakistan. And suddenly the Assembly was put off. The blame was placed squarely on the people of Bengal, the blame was put at my door. Once the Assembly meeting was postponed, the people of this land decided to put up resistance to the act."
4675,1972,Bangladesh,I enjoined upon them to observe a peaceful general strike. I instructed them to close down all factories and industrial installations. The people responded positively to my directives. Through sheer spontaneity they emerged on to the streets. They were determined to pursue their struggle through peaceful means.
4676,1972,Bangladesh,"What have we attained? The weapons we have bought with our money to defend the country against foreign aggression are being used against the poor and down-trodden of my country today. It is their hearts the bullets pierce today. We are the majority in Pakistan. Whenever we Bengalis have attempted to ascend to the heights of power, they have swooped upon us."
4677,1972,Bangladesh,"I have spoken to him over telephone. I told him, Mr. Yahya Khan, you are the President of Pakistan. Come, be witness to the inhuman manner in which the people of my Bengal are being murdered, to the way in which the mothers of my land are being deprived of their sons."" I told him, ""come, see and dispense justice"". But he construously said that I had agreed to participate in a Round Table Conference to be held on 10 March. I have already said a long time ago, what RTC? With whom do I sit down to talk? Do I fraternise with those have taken the blood of my people? All of a sudden, without discussing matters with me and after a secret meeting lasting five hours, he has delivered a speech in which he has placed all responsibility for the impasse on me, on the people of Bengal."
4678,1972,Bangladesh,"My brothers,"
4679,1972,Bangladesh,"They have called the Assembly for the twenty-fifth. The marks of blood have not yet dried up. I said on the tenth that Mujibur Rahman would not walk across that blood to take part in a Round Table Conference. You have called the Assembly. But my demands must be met first. Martial Law must be withdrawn. All military personnel must be taken back to the barracks. An inquiry must be conducted into the manner in which the killings have been caused. And power must be transferred to the elected representatives of the people. And only then shall we consider the question of whether or not to sit in the National Assembly. Prior to the fulfilment of our demands, we cannot take part in the Assembly."
4680,1972,Bangladesh,"I do not desire the office of Prime Minister. I wish to see the rights of the people of this country established. Let me make it clear, without ambiguity, that beginning today, in Bangladesh, all courts, magistracies, government offices and educational institutions will remain closed for an indefinite period. In order that the poor do not suffer, in order that my people do not go through pain, all other activities will continue, will not come within the ambit of the general strike from tomorrow. Rickshaws, horse carriages, trains and river vessels will ply. The Supreme Court, High Court, Judge's Court, semi-government offices, WAPDA,-nothing will work. Employees will collect their salaries on the twenty-eighth. But if the salaries are not paid, if another bullet is fired, if any more of the people are murdered, it is my directive to all of you: turn every house into a fortress, resist the enemy with everything you have. And for the sake of life, even if I am not around to guide you, direct you, close off all roads and pathways."
4681,1972,Bangladesh,"We will strive them into submission. We will submerge them in water. You are our brothers. Return to your barracks and no harm will come to you. But do not try to pour bullets into my heart again. You cannot keep seventy five million people in bondage. Now that we have learnt to die, no power on earth can keep us in subjugation."
4682,1972,Bangladesh,"For those who have embraced martyrdom, and for those who have sustained injuries we in the Awami League will do all we can to relieve their tragedy. Those among you who can please lend a helping hand through contributing to our relief committee. The owners of industries will make certain that the wages of workers who have taken part in the strike for the past week are duly paid to them. I shall tell employees of the government, my word must be heard, and my instructions followed. Until freedom comes to my land, all taxes will be held back from payment. No one will pay them. Bear in mind that the enemy has infiltrated our ranks to cause confusion and sow discord among us. In our Bengal, everyone, be the Hindu or Muslim, Bengali or non-Bengali, is our brother. It is our responsibility to ensure their security. Our good name must not be sullied."
4683,1972,Bangladesh,"And remember, employees at radio and television, if radio does not get our message across, no Bengali will go to the radio station. If television does not put forth our point of view, no Bengali will go to television. Banks will remain open for two hours to enable people to engage in transactions. But there will be no transfer of even a single penny from East Bengal to West Pakistan. Telephone and telegram services will continue in East Bengal and news can be despatched overseas."
4684,1972,Bangladesh,"But if moves are made to exterminate the people of this country, Bengalis must act with caution. In every village, every neighbourhood, set up Sangram Parishad under the leadership of the Awami League. And be prepared with whatever you have. Remember: Having mastered the lesson of sacrifice, we shall give more blood. God willing, we shall free the people of this land. The struggle this time is a struggle for emancipation. The struggle this time is a struggle for independence."

7273,1981,Belize,"b.respect the principles of social justice and therefore believe that the operation of the economic system must result in the material resources of the community being so distributed as to subserve the common good, that there should be adequate means of livelihood for all, that labour should not be exploited or forced by economic necessity to operate in inhumane conditions but that there should be opportunity for advancement on the basis of recognition of merit, ability and integrity, that equal protection should be given to children regardless of their social status, and that a just system should be ensured to provide for education and health on the basis of equality;"
7274,1981,Belize,"c.believe that the will of the people shall form the basis of government in a democratic society in which the government is freely elected by universal adult suffrage and in which all persons may, to the extent of their capacity, play some part in the institutions of national life and thus develop and maintain due respect for lawfully constituted authority;"
7275,1981,Belize,d.recognise that men and institutions remain free only when freedom is founded upon respect for moral and spiritual values and upon the rule of law;

7277,1981,Belize,"f.desire that their society shall reflect and enjoy the above mentioned principles, beliefs and needs and that their Constitution should therefore enshrine and make provisions for ensuring the achievement of the same in Belize;"
