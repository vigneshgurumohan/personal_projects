3684,1968,Mauritius,f.that reasons should have been given for the decision; or
3685,1968,Mauritius,"g.that any other steps should be taken,"
3686,1968,Mauritius,"the Ombudsman shall report his opinion, and his reasons, to the principal officer of any department or authority concerned, and may make such recommendations as he thinks fit; he may request that officer to notify him, within a specified time, of any steps that it is proposed to take to give effect to his recommendations; and he shall also send a copy of his report and recommendations to the Prime Minister and to any Minister concerned."
3687,1968,Mauritius,"3.
